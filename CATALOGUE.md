# Catalogue log

Every migration catalogued here, in the order it was catalogued (oldest
first): what it does, its risk tier, the backup it rode, the
`migration list --linked` counts, the hosted smoke test and the rollback.
`CLAUDE.md` holds the rules and names the latest applied migration; this
file is the record. Moved here verbatim from `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-25.

**Adding an entry:** a catalogue PR appends a `(**catalogued, not yet
applied**)` entry at the end. After the push, the "applied" PR marks it
`(**applied <date>**)`, adds the push, backup, counts and smoke row, and
bumps the "Latest applied migration" line in `CLAUDE.md`.

## Entries

- `202608160001_cogitster_solo.sql` was already applied to the shared project.
- Cogitster's `202608160002_lock_down_trigger_execute.sql` is intentionally
  not catalogued yet because it has not been applied and is unrelated to the
  KUT release.
- KUT migrations through
  `20260829130000_admin_manage_roster.sql` are catalogued and applied to the
  hosted project. `20260829000000` (applied 2026-08-29) completed August
  2026: sessions 21.08 / 28.08 and four new 2+-appearance players (Steffen,
  Serhat, Stephen, Maarten). `20260829120000_admin_add_player.sql` and
  `20260829130000_admin_manage_roster.sql` (applied 2026-08-29) are
  function-only: KUT's server-authoritative roster RPCs (`admin_add_player`,
  ADR-025; `admin_set_player_active` / `admin_delete_player`, ADR-026) so the
  roster is managed from `/admin/roster` rather than a migration each time.
- `20260830000000` / `20260831000000` / `20260901000000` (**applied
  2026-08-30**): KUT's alpha-readiness batch, ADR-027..030.
  Member `player_directory` view + ownership-gated self-service RPCs (own card
  photo + archetype), a private `player-photos` storage bucket with
  folder-scoped `storage.objects` RLS, `profiles.username` login handle,
  `admin_set_profile_player` / `admin_set_account_disabled` /
  `admin_prepare_account_deletion`, a dated attendance-reward inbox message
  (amount 75 → 250, not retroactive), and a members-only
  `club_value_leaderboard`. First migration to touch the `storage` schema.
  Pushed as one batch from this repo after KUT PR #8 merged; the
  `player-photos` bucket (private, 5 MiB, webp/jpeg/png) and its four
  `storage.objects` policies were confirmed on the hosted project.
- `20260902000000_starter_reveal_and_rating_snapshots.sql` (**applied
  2026-08-30**): KUT's ADR-031. Adds
  `kut.player_rating_snapshots` + an `after`-trigger on
  `kut.player_season_state` (`kut.capture_rating_snapshot`) that upserts a
  per-week OVR snapshot keyed on `last_week_start`, the `kut.top_risers` view
  (two-most-recent-weeks positive delta), `kut.profiles.starter_opened_at`
  (backfilled `= starter_claimed_at`), `kut.mark_starter_opened()`, and
  widens `kut.my_pack_opening_results` with `players.photo_path` (`create or
  replace view`, append-only). Migration-time seed inserts the current week's
  snapshots. Rollback DDL is in the migration header. Pushed from this repo
  2026-08-30 (KUT PR #10 was already merged); `kut.player_rating_snapshots`,
  `kut.top_risers`, `kut.profiles.starter_opened_at`, `kut.mark_starter_opened`
  and `kut.my_pack_opening_results.photo_path` confirmed on the hosted project.
- `20260903000000_drop_is_tradeable.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-033. Retires the untradeable card concept — drops
  `kut.user_cards.is_tradeable`, rebuilds `kut.my_collection_cards` (`drop
  view` + `create view`, since a column can't be dropped via `create or
  replace view`), and recreates `grant_starter_pack`, `open_pack`,
  `discard_card`, `get_listing_bounds`, `create_listing`, `buy_listing`
  without the flag. Data-changing tier (ADR-032): fresh encrypted backup
  immediately before the push; lossless reverse DDL in the migration header
  (every surviving row was `true`). Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after
  KUT PR #17 merged; a hosted `kut` dump confirms zero `is_tradeable`
  references, the six recreated functions, and `user_cards` without the
  column.
- `20260904000000_canonical_coin_name.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-034 (tester feedback #7). "KUT Coins" becomes the one currency name.
  `create or replace` of `open_pack` + `buy_listing` (latest `20260903000000`
  bodies) with `TF Coins` → `KUT Coins` in the two insufficient-funds `raise`
  strings and the two `market_purchase` / `market_sale` notification
  `format()` bodies, then a one-shot backfill of existing
  `kut.user_notifications` rows scoped to those event types. Data-changing
  tier (ADR-032) only for the backfill `UPDATE`: fresh encrypted backup
  immediately before the push; reverse `replace()` in the migration header,
  scoped so it is lossless (`attendance_reward` bodies already said "KUT
  Coins"). No economy value, ledger `reason`, column, price, or formula
  change. Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after KUT PR #19 merged; a hosted
  `kut` dump shows zero `TF Coins` references.
- `20260905000000_admin_economy_tools.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-035 (tester feedback #8 + #6). `kut.admin_adjust_wallet(uuid, bigint,
  text)` — audited coin faucet, both directions, `abs` cap 100000, never below
  zero, typed reason; `wallet_ledger.reason 'admin_grant'` + a
  `kut.admin_account_events` row + an `admin_notice` inbox message.
  `kut.admin_reset_account(uuid, uuid)` — soft reset: cancels active listings,
  soft-burns owned cards, deletes pack history + notifications, zeroes the
  wallet via a `-(balance)` + `+250` ledger pair (`reason 'admin_reset'`,
  net 250), re-grants the 3-card starter inline, nulls `starter_opened_at` to
  replay `/welcome`; keeps `market_sales`, market ledger rows and
  `attendance_rewards` guard rows; idempotent on `p_idempotency_key`.
  `kut.admin_account_events` audit table, admin-read RLS. `wallet_ledger.reason`
  check widened with `admin_grant` / `admin_reset`. Additive tier (ADR-032):
  all `create table` / `create or replace function` / one widened check; no
  data migration (the reset mutates rows at run time), so it rode the last
  scheduled backup. Reverse DDL in the migration header. Pushed from this repo
  2026-08-31 after KUT PR #21 + catalogue PR #15 merged; a hosted `kut` dump
  confirms `kut.admin_account_events` (+ partial unique index + RLS policy),
  both RPCs, and `wallet_ledger_reason_check` listing the two new reasons.
- `20260906000000_goalkeeper_archetype.sql` /
  `20260907000000_bibs_bonus.sql` / `20260908000000_activity_feed.sql`
  (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's Batch E (tester feedback #4 / #5 / #10 —
  ADR-036 / 037 / 038), the last tester-feedback batch. All three **additive
  tier (ADR-032)** — one `db push` on the last scheduled backup, no fresh
  pre-push backup; reverse DDL in each header.
  **E1** a seventh `goalkeeper` archetype reusing the six shared attributes
  (`pac -6, sho -12, pas 0, dri -8, def +14, phy +12`, sums to 0): widens the
  `kut.players` archetype `check` and `create or replace`s `admin_add_player`
  / `set_own_player_archetype` / `_rebuild_season_core` (a `when 'goalkeeper'`
  arm on each of the six attribute `CASE`s). No player pre-assigned, so no
  data change.
  **E2** a `+100` KUT Coins bonus for the bibs washer, coins only: nullable
  `kut.match_sessions.bibs_washed_by`, the `kut.bibs_rewards` guard table,
  `kut.grant_bibs_reward(uuid)` (called from
  `process_published_session_rewards`), `wallet_ledger.reason` +
  `user_notifications.event_type` widened with `bibs_bonus`, and a trailing
  `p_bibs_washed_by uuid default null` on `publish_`/`correct_` attendance
  RPCs (old signatures dropped + recreated, since a `create or replace` can't
  widen the arg list). Forward-only on corrections.
  **E3** one read-only `kut.activity_feed` view (`security_invoker = false`,
  `security_barrier = true`, `grant select to authenticated`) unioning
  completed sales, active listings, pack openings and published sessions; the
  sale rows expose the buyer name club-wide.
  Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after KUT PRs #23 / #24 / #25 + catalogue
  PR #17 merged; a hosted `kut` dump confirms all of the above, both attendance
  RPCs present only as the new 5-/6-arg signatures, and no drift on the 36
  prior migrations.
- `20260909000000_market_listing_card_art.sql` /
  `20260910000000_club_value_v2.sql` / `20260911000000_trade_offers.sql`
  (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's tester follow-up trio (ADR-040 / 041 / 042),
  catalogued and pushed via PR #19. `20260909` additive (`kut.active_market_listings`
  gains `photo_path` + `seller_id`); `20260910` data-changing (Club Value v2 —
  `my_club_value` dropped + recreated, `club_value_leaderboard` replaced,
  economy formula change) with a fresh pre-push backup; `20260911`
  data-changing (coin + card escrow trade offers — new `trade_offers` /
  `trade_offer_cards` tables, `user_cards.held_by_offer_id`, guards threaded
  through the market/discard/reset RPCs, `wallet_ledger.reason` +
  `user_notifications.event_type` widened, `activity_feed` gains a `trade`
  row). `scripts/verify-catalog.ps1` and this catalogue note were not updated
  at the time; both are brought current in PR #20 below.
- `20260912000000_tester_feedback_round_2.sql` (**applied 2026-09-01**): KUT's
  tester feedback round 2 (ADR-044), one migration for four defects + three
  ideas. **Data-changing tier (ADR-032)** solely for a scoped, reversible
  backfill of existing `bibs_bonus` `kut.user_notifications` bodies ("washing
  the bibs after" → "bringing the bibs to"); the rest is additive —
  `create or replace kut.grant_bibs_reward` (same body, one string changed),
  new `kut.set_own_club_name(text)` self-service RPC writing the dormant
  `kut.profiles.club_name` column, `create or replace kut.club_value_leaderboard`
  to `coalesce` that column with the synthesised `"<name>'s Club"` default (no
  `club_value` / `rank` change), and a new additive `kut.published_sessions`
  summary view. Fresh encrypted backup immediately before the push; full
  reverse DDL in the migration header. Pushed from this repo 2026-09-01 after
  KUT PR #31 + catalogue PR #20 merged; `migration list --linked` shows
  `20260912000000` Local = Remote with no drift on the 44 prior migrations.
- `20260913000000_chronicle_views.sql` (**applied 2026-09-02**): KUT's TFH
  Chronicle read projections (ADR-049). **Additive tier (ADR-032)** — two
  computed views and their grants, no data change, no existing object
  rewritten. `kut.chronicle_weeks` aggregates published `kut.match_sessions` +
  `kut.attendance` into one row per football week; `kut.chronicle_tier_changes`
  runs a `lag()` over `kut.player_rating_snapshots` for consecutive weeks where
  a player's rarity tier differs. Both `security_invoker = true,
  security_barrier = true` (every underlying select is already permitted to
  members), `revoke all from public`, `grant select to authenticated,
  service_role`. Rode the last scheduled backup per the additive tier; reverse
  DDL is two `drop view`s, in the migration header. Catalogued in PR #22 and
  pushed from this repo 2026-09-02 after KUT PR #36 merged; `migration list
  --linked` shows `20260913000000` Local = Remote with no drift on the 45 prior
  migrations.
- `20260914000000_admin_self_wallet_grant.sql` (**applied 2026-09-04**): KUT's
  ADR-052. A second, superadmin-only coin faucet, `kut.admin_grant_self_wallet(bigint,
  text, uuid)`, that targets the caller's own wallet (`auth.uid()`) rather than
  an arbitrary `p_user_id`. `kut.admin_adjust_wallet` (ADR-035) keeps refusing
  to touch the caller's own wallet for every role, including superadmin — that
  guard is untouched; this is a separate function with its own audit tags
  (`wallet_ledger.reason 'admin_self_grant'`, `admin_account_events.action
  'self_wallet_grant'`) so a self-grant is never indistinguishable from an
  admin crediting a member. Same guards as `admin_adjust_wallet` (`abs` cap
  100000, never below zero, 1–200 char reason), plus a real
  `p_idempotency_key` backed by a partial unique index — closing a gap
  `admin_adjust_wallet` itself has. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: one
  `create or replace function`, two widened check constraints
  (`admin_account_events.action`, `wallet_ledger.reason`), one new partial
  index; nothing existing is rewritten or dropped, no data migration, so it
  rode the last scheduled backup (2026-09-02). Reverse DDL in the migration
  header. Catalogued in PR #24 and pushed from this repo 2026-09-04 after KUT
  PR #43 + catalogue PR #24 merged; `migration list --linked` shows
  `20260914000000` Local = Remote with no drift on the 46 prior migrations. A
  hosted `kut` schema dump confirms `kut.admin_grant_self_wallet`, the two
  widened check constraints, and `admin_account_events_self_grant_idem_idx`
  all present.
- `20260915000000_activity_feed_excludes_superadmin.sql` (**applied
  2026-09-05**): KUT's ADR-054, KB-009. `create or replace view
  kut.activity_feed` adds a `role <> 'superadmin'` guard on whichever
  profile(s) generated each row — seller and buyer for a `sale`, seller and
  proposer for a `trade`, seller for a `listing`, opener for a `pack`. The
  `session` branch is untouched, since a published session isn't one
  member's economic activity. Fixes the production superadmin demo/test
  account's own pack opens, sales, listings and trades showing up in the
  member-facing club activity feed on Home. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: one
  `create or replace view`, same columns, no table, grant, or RLS change on
  the underlying `market_sales` / `trade_offers` / `market_listings` /
  `pack_openings` — their ledger and audit history are fully retained, only
  this read projection is narrower; rode the last scheduled backup, no fresh
  pre-push backup required. Reverse DDL (restore the pre-guard view body) is
  in the migration header. Catalogued in PR #26 and pushed from this repo
  2026-09-05 after KUT PR #59 + catalogue PR #26 merged; `migration list
  --linked` shows `20260915000000` Local = Remote with no drift on the 47
  prior migrations. A hosted `kut` schema dump confirms
  `kut.activity_feed`'s `sale` / `trade` / `listing` / `pack` branches all
  carry the `role <> 'superadmin'` guard, with both grants to `authenticated`
  and `service_role` intact.
- `20260922000000_kudos_cap_two_and_award_notice.sql` (**applied
  2026-09-07**): KUT's ADR-063. Raises the
  kudos half of rating v2. The qualified-kudos Form ladder becomes
  `0 / 1 / 1.5 / 2` for `0 / 1 / 2 / 3` recognised categories (was
  `0 / 1 / 1.25 / 1.5`); the combined per-session Form input cap rises
  `3 → 3.5` (`kut.session_report_results.session_input` `check` dropped by
  `pg_get_constraintdef` lookup and re-added as
  `session_report_results_session_input_check` = `0..3.5`); goals still cap at
  1.5 and the v2 Form ceiling stays 8. `kut.user_notifications.event_type`
  gains `kudos_awarded` (same drop-by-lookup and re-add of
  `user_notifications_event_type_check`). `create or replace
  kut._finalize_one_session` — the new ladder, `least(3.5, goal_form +
  kudos_form)`, a `jsonb_object_agg` snapshot of every player's
  `kut.player_season_state.live_ovr` taken *before* `kut._rebuild_season_core`,
  and one extra insert: for each attendee with
  `cardinality(qualified_category_ids) > 0`, a `kudos_awarded`
  `kut.user_notifications` row that never names a nominator and states the
  player's OVR movement from finalising that session (goals + kudos), or no
  number when it is `<= 0`. Idempotent on
  `(user_id, event_type, reference_type, reference_id)` and sent alongside the
  existing club-wide `session_results` notice, so an admin goal correction that
  re-finalises neither resends nor restates it. **Data-changing tier
  (ADR-032)**: a scoped `update kut.session_report_results` re-scores existing
  derived result rows to the new ladder/cap, then a `do $$` loop replays every
  affected season through `kut._rebuild_season_core`. Raw reports, ballots,
  `session_report_rewards`, `wallet_ledger`, transactions and `session_surveys`
  audit timestamps are untouched; historical finalised sessions emit no
  `kudos_awarded`. A fresh encrypted `kut`-schema backup was taken immediately
  before the push. Reverse DDL in the migration header restores the `0..3`
  check, drops `kudos_awarded` from the event_type check, restores the prior
  `_finalize_one_session` body (`… when 2 then 1.25 else 1.5`, `least(3, …)`,
  no OVR snapshot or notice), and re-scores + replays. Catalogued in PR #29
  and pushed from this repo 2026-09-07 after KUT PR #65 + catalogue PR #29
  merged; `migration list --linked` shows `20260922000000` Local = Remote with
  no drift on the prior migrations. Hosted checks confirm
  `session_report_results_session_input_check` is
  `CHECK ((session_input >= 0) AND (session_input <= 3.5))`,
  `user_notifications_event_type_check` lists `kudos_awarded`, and
  `pg_get_functiondef('kut._finalize_one_session(uuid)')` carries the
  `0 / 1 / 1.5 / 2` ladder, `least(3.5, …)` and the `kudos_awarded` insert.
  `kut.session_report_results` is empty on hosted (no v2 survey finalised yet),
  so the re-score `update` and the season replay touched zero rows.

- `20260923000000_chronicle_results_visibility.sql` (**applied 2026-09-08**):
  KUT's ADR-066, additive. Fixes a live read blackout: the Chronicle's
  finalized per-player results were readable only by that session's attendees
  and admins, so every member who missed the session saw "Results finalized. No
  report results were recorded." while an admin on the same URL saw the full
  table. `kut.chronicle_session_reports` ran with `security_invoker=true` and
  inner-joins `kut.session_surveys`, whose `"eligible members read surveys"`
  policy admits only `kut.is_admin()` or a member holding a
  `kut.session_survey_eligibility` row. The `"members read finalized results"`
  policy on `kut.session_report_results` failed identically, because Postgres
  applies a referenced table's RLS inside a policy expression, so its `exists()`
  over `session_surveys` was blind too. `create or replace view` flips the
  projection to `security_invoker=false`, matching its sibling
  `kut.chronicle_session_report_status` (`20260920090000`), and the policy is
  dropped and recreated over a new `security definer`
  `kut.is_survey_finalized(uuid)` (`revoke` from `public`/`anon`, `grant` to
  `authenticated`/`service_role`). Side effect: `submitted_reports`,
  `eligible_accounts` and `attendee_count` — sub-selects over RLS-scoped tables
  that made an attendee compute "1 of 1 reports submitted" — now report
  club-wide counts. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: no `update`, no backfill, no
  season replay; the 7 September survey was already finalized, so this changed
  what members may read, not any stored result. No new disclosure —
  `effective_goals` is already club-wide as
  `chronicle_session_report_status.goal_total`, `recognized_categories` lists
  only categories two or more nominators agreed on, and `goal_form` /
  `kudos_form` / `session_input` are pure functions of those two under ADR-063.
  The join on `status='finalized'` is now the only guard keeping an open session
  out of the projection. Reverse DDL in the migration header restores the
  invoker view and the inline-`exists()` policy and drops the function, which
  reinstates the blackout. Catalogued in PR #31 and pushed from this repo
  2026-09-08 after KUT PR #69 + #70 and catalogue PR #31 merged. Hosted checks
  confirm `chronicle_session_reports` reports `security_invoker` = `false` and
  `kut.is_survey_finalized` exists.
- `20260924000000_admin_finalize_session_survey.sql` (**applied 2026-09-08**):
  KUT's ADR-067, additive. Lets an admin close a session's report window before
  its 24 hours elapse instead of waiting for the deadline and the ADR-061 lazy
  fallback. `kut.session_surveys` gains nullable `finalized_by` (references
  `kut.profiles(id) on delete restrict`) and `finalized_reason` (`check` 3–500
  chars when present); `kut.admin_finalize_session_survey(uuid, text)` is a
  `security definer` front door to the existing `kut._finalize_one_session`, so
  scoring, `kut._rebuild_season_core` and the `session_results` /
  `kudos_awarded` notifications are unchanged — only the timing moves. Gated on
  `kut.is_admin()`, requires a 3–500 character reason, refuses a cancelled
  survey, returns `already_finalized` rather than raising on a second press, and
  returns the attendee / eligible / submitted counts plus whether the
  three-ballot kudos quorum was met. `closes_at` is deliberately not moved: the
  table's `check (closes_at = opened_at + interval '24 hours')` would force
  rewriting `opened_at` and erase when the window opened, so the published
  deadline stands and an early close reads as `finalized_at < closes_at`. Both
  audit columns stay null on the automatic path and on the re-finalization
  `kut.admin_correct_session_goals` triggers, so null means "closed at its
  deadline". Nothing downstream needed changing — every consumer already keys
  off `session_surveys.status`. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: no data change;
  every existing survey row takes `finalized_by = null`. A member who had not
  submitted when an admin closes the window loses the window and the 50-coin
  completion reward; rewards already earned are untouched. Reverse DDL in the
  migration header drops the function and both columns. Catalogued in PR #31 and
  pushed from this repo 2026-09-08 in the same `db push` as
  `20260923000000`. Hosted checks confirm both columns exist and are nullable,
  `kut.admin_finalize_session_survey` exists, and
  `select count(*) from kut.session_surveys where finalized_by is not null`
  returns 0.
- `20260925000000_kudos_award_notice_detail.sql` (**applied 2026-09-08**):
  KUT's ADR-069. Text-only follow-up to `20260922000000`'s `kudos_awarded`
  notice, which read "Teammates recognized you with kudos this session. Your
  card rating rose +N OVR this week." — it named none of the categories the
  player was actually recognised in, and implied the whole week's movement came
  from kudos. New immutable `kut._join_names(text[])` renders a name list as
  `A`, `A and B` or `A, B and C` (`revoke all from public, anon`; execute to
  `service_role` only — it is called from inside a `security definer` function,
  never by the browser). `create or replace kut._finalize_one_session` — same
  scoring, same `kut._rebuild_season_core`, same pre-rebuild `live_ovr`
  snapshot, same `session_results` notice, same idempotency key. Only the
  `kudos_awarded` body changes: it now names every recognised category ordered
  by `array_position(v_survey.category_ids, c.id)` — ballot order, so the notice
  lists them the way the member saw them, not `category_id` order — and
  attributes the movement to this session's goals *and* kudos, naming the goal
  count from `session_report_results.effective_goals` when it is `> 0` ("Your 2
  goals and these kudos lifted your card rating +3 OVR this week", "Your 1
  goal…") and claiming no goals when it is not ("These kudos lifted…"). A
  movement of `<= 0` still yields no rating sentence, and the notice still names
  no nominator. Attributing the finalisation delta to goals + kudos is accurate:
  appearances were already counted when the session was published, so the report
  results are the only new input at finalisation. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**:
  one new function plus one `create or replace`; no table, constraint, grant,
  scoring rule or rating-maths change, and no DML. Notices already written keep
  the ADR-063 wording — re-finalising hits the existing `on conflict
  (user_id, event_type, reference_type, reference_id) do nothing` — so the club
  sees a mix until the next session finalises, which was preferred over
  rewriting notices members had already read. Relied on the most recent
  scheduled backup (`20260908-215210`) rather than a fresh one, per the additive
  tier. Reverse DDL in the migration header: drop `kut._join_names(text[])`,
  then re-run the `create or replace function kut._finalize_one_session` block
  from `20260922000000_kudos_cap_two_and_award_notice.sql`. Catalogued and
  pushed from this repo 2026-09-08. `migration list --linked` shows
  `20260925000000` Local = Remote with no drift across the ledger, and the
  catalogue check reports 65 approved source migrations.
- `20260926000000_trade_log_rating_story_listing_duration.sql` (**applied
  2026-09-16**): KUT's ADR-072 + ADR-073 + ADR-074, shipped in
  one file. **Three features in one migration is deliberate and exceptional** —
  KUT's own convention is one migration-bearing feature per PR, and its
  `migrations` CI job enforces at most one added migration file per change. The
  owner instructed the batch on 2026-09-16 so the hosted schema is pushed once
  rather than three times; KUT's ADR-075 records the reasoning, that the
  file-count invariant is satisfied honestly rather than circumvented, and that
  it sets no precedent. Each section is an independently reviewable slice with
  its own ADR, its own database test file and its own reverse DDL, and the three
  touch disjoint objects, so no section can mask a defect in another. Postgres
  DDL being transactional, a failure anywhere rolls the whole file back — which
  is why one push is safer here than three sequential ones, not merely quicker.
  **Zero DML**: no `insert`, `update` or `delete` against member data anywhere
  in the file, no table created or altered, no backfill, and no economy or
  rating formula changed. Every input the three features read already existed
  and was simply never projected.
  - **Section 1 (ADR-072)** — a seller chooses a 24- or 72-hour listing.
    `kut.market_listings.expires_at` has carried
    `default (now() + interval '24 hours')` since `20260816070600`, and expiry
    has always been enforced lazily by the `expires_at > now()` predicates in
    the table's RLS policy, `kut.active_market_listings`,
    `kut.my_collection_cards`, `kut.activity_feed`, `kut.buy_listing`,
    `kut.propose_trade` and `kut.prevent_burning_listed_card`, plus the
    opportunistic self-heal in `create_listing`/`buy_listing`. None of that
    moves; only the value written at insert time does, and the column default
    stays 24h. `drop function if exists kut.create_listing(uuid, bigint)` comes
    **first and is load-bearing**: a defaulted third parameter creates an
    *overload*, not a replacement, which would have left the two-argument entry
    point alive and permanently 24-hour. The new parameter defaults to 24, so
    existing two-argument callers stay valid. Body rebased on the current
    `20260911000000_trade_offers.sql` definition so the ADR-042
    `held_by_offer_id` escrow guard survives. Duration is an allow-list
    (`not in (24, 72)`, with `null` checked explicitly), dual-declared with
    `ECONOMY.listingDurationChoiceHours` in the KUT repo. The insert now names
    `expires_at` and uses `returning` instead of the previous hardcoded
    `now() + interval '24 hours'` in the return payload, which was never read
    back from the row.
  - **Section 2 (ADR-073)** — `create or replace view kut.activity_feed` so an
    accepted trade reports its whole consideration. Two fixes. The trade branch
    reported `trade_offers.coins_to_seller` while every other branch reports
    gross (`market_sales.sale_price`, `market_listings.price`,
    `pack_openings.price_paid`); it now reports `trade_offers.offered_coins`, so
    `amount` means the same thing in all five branches. **Existing trades will
    therefore display ~5% higher after this is applied** — no row is rewritten,
    `coins_to_seller` and `coins_burned` are untouched, and the seller still
    sees the real post-burn receipt on `/market/offers`; the feed simply reports
    the price rather than the proceeds. Second, `kut.trade_offer_cards` was
    never joined, so cards moving the other way were invisible; a `left join
    lateral` `array_agg` now supplies them in a new **ninth column**
    `offered_card_names text[]`, appended last because `create or replace view`
    can only append (the same constraint `20260909000000` met) — all five
    branches carry it, four as `null::text[]`. `left join`, not `cross join`, so
    a coins-only trade still yields a row with `null` rather than an empty
    array. Stays `security_invoker = false`, so the new join raises no RLS
    question; both `role <> 'superadmin'` guards (ADR-054 / KB-009) are
    unchanged, and the branch still does not reference `kut.market_sales`, so
    KUT Part L invariant #23 holds.
  - **Section 3 (ADR-074)** — two new read projections behind a "why this
    rating" story: `kut.player_rating_breakdown` and
    `kut.player_form_contributions`, both
    `security_invoker = true, security_barrier = true`,
    `revoke all from public`, `grant select to authenticated, service_role`.
    Invoker rights are deliberate and the opposite of section 2: they make the
    caller's own RLS apply, so `kut.session_report_results` stays gated to
    finalized surveys by `kut.is_survey_finalized` (ADR-066). Definer views
    would have bypassed that gate and exposed unfinalized results. The OVR split
    is *derived, not recomputed*: `form_bonus` is `floor(form_score + 0.5)`, the
    engine's own final rounding, and `attendance_base` is `live_ovr` minus that,
    so the halves reconstruct the stored `live_ovr` by construction rather than
    risking an off-by-one against a re-evaluated
    `30 + 45*(activity/100)^0.8`; `is_ovr_capped` flags the 83 clamp.
    `player_form_contributions` mirrors the session-age decay ladder
    (1 / .75 / .5 / .25 / 0) and the `(session_date, session_type, id)` tuple
    ordering from `kut._rebuild_season_core`. **That duplication is the one
    maintenance hazard in this file** — change the ladder in the engine without
    changing the view and the view lies silently — and it is pinned by
    `rating_breakdown.test.sql`, which runs the real `_rebuild_season_core` over
    a fixture and asserts the summed `weighted_contribution` equals the
    resulting `player_season_state.form_score`. Neither view may join
    `kut.session_kudos` (nominator identity) or `kut.session_surveys` (whose
    attendee-only policy caused the KB-013 blackout); a test asserts this via
    `information_schema.view_table_usage` rather than trusting review.
  - **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: relies on the most recent scheduled backup
    rather than a fresh pre-push one; no restore drill. Reverse DDL is in the
    migration header, per section: drop
    `kut.create_listing(uuid, bigint, integer)` and recreate the two-argument
    version from `20260911000000_trade_offers.sql`; re-run the view body from
    `20260915000000_activity_feed_excludes_superadmin.sql`; and drop both new
    views, which nothing else references. Section 2's rollback restores the
    eight-column shape, so application code selecting `offered_card_names` must
    be reverted with it.
  - **Sequencing note.** KUT's KB-017 (2026-09-16 Supabase Security Advisor
    review) names `kut.activity_feed` among the definer projections that grant
    `SELECT` to `authenticated` without proving an active KUT profile. This
    migration neither causes nor worsens that finding — the view already had
    those properties — but whoever fixes KB-017 **must rebase on this version of
    the view**, or they will silently revert the gross-coins fix and drop the
    ninth column.
  - Merged as KUT PR #86 (`aa1f254`); KUT CI green on `migrations`, `database`,
    `e2e`, `fast`, `merge-gate`, `security` and `scan`. Catalogue check reports
    66 approved source migrations.
  - Catalogued via PR #34 and pushed from this repo 2026-09-16, on a fresh
    cold-verified backup (`20260916-005721`) taken minutes before rather than
    the scheduled one the additive tier would have allowed. Smoke-tested on
    hosted immediately after: a card lists for 72 hours and shows its real
    expiry date, the club activity feed returns rows again, and a Live card
    renders its rating buildup.
  - **Ordering note for the future.** KUT's Vercel production deploy fires on
    merge to its `main`, so merging PR #86 shipped application code that
    expected this schema **before** the schema existed. For roughly two hours
    creating a market listing failed on hosted — `create_listing` was called
    with `p_duration_hours` against the old two-argument signature — and the
    club activity feed rendered empty, because selecting the not-yet-existing
    `offered_card_names` errored and that widget is deliberately non-critical.
    Nothing crashed and no data was at risk, but the lesson generalises: when a
    tool's app deploy is coupled to its own merge, the catalogue push should be
    ready to follow immediately, or the app change should tolerate the old
    schema. Worth considering a feature flag or a tolerant read for the next
    migration whose code cannot degrade as gracefully as this one did.

- `20260927000000_session_report_status_is_monotonic.sql` (**applied
  2026-09-22**): KUT's ADR-078, fixing KB-020. Merged in KUT PR #91
  (`9f43c41`). A member who had already
  submitted a session report could press "Save draft" and silently move their
  own report back to `draft`, while `kut.session_report_rewards` — written once
  on the original submit and never deleted — kept the 50-coin reward. The admin
  roster joins the two independently and displayed exactly that: "Draft ·
  Reward paid".
  **Not cosmetic.** `kut._finalize_one_session` scores only `status='submitted'`
  rows and uses the same filter for the `v_turnout>=3` gate that decides whether
  any kudos are recognised in a session, so a report left in this state at
  finalization drops that member's goals and kudos and can wipe kudos
  recognition for everyone present — while their `kut.session_kudos` rows still
  count toward recipients' two-nominator threshold.
  **DDL**: one `create or replace function kut.submit_session_report`. The body
  is the `20260920000000` original with one new local, `v_intent`, derived from
  the stored row before any validation runs, plus its five uses. No table
  created or altered, no constraint, grant or trigger changed, no economy or
  rating formula touched. A guard inside the `on conflict do update` was
  rejected: it would hold the status while letting the row be rewritten under
  the weaker draft validation, leaving a submitted report with a null goal
  count or an incomplete ballot.
  **DML, and this is the data-changing part**: one scoped `update` repairing
  rows where `status='draft'` sits beside a `kut.session_report_rewards` row.
  That combination is reachable by no other path — a reward row is written only
  by a real submit and is never deleted — so the predicate is exact.
  `submitted_at` is recovered from `updated_at`, the closest surviving evidence.
  **Deliberately not replayed**: sessions already finalized with a regressed
  report are *not* re-scored, although `kut._finalize_one_session` is
  re-runnable and `kut.admin_correct_session_goals` calls it exactly that way.
  Owner decision, 2026-09-22: replaying would move live OVR for real members
  retroactively, push `finalized_at` forward and disturb the ADR-067 reading of
  `finalized_at < closes_at` as "closed early". The consequence is that for an
  already-finalized session those goals and kudos stay out of that week's
  scoring. A later `admin_correct_session_goals` on such a session re-scores it
  correctly.
  **Tier: data-changing.** Needs a fresh cold-verified backup before the push,
  not the scheduled one — the same treatment ADR-063 had.
  **Reverse DDL** in the migration header: re-emit the pre-KB-020 body of
  `kut.submit_session_report` verbatim from
  `20260920000000_session_reports_rating_v2.sql:242-308` as
  `create or replace function`. The backfill is **not** reversible: nothing
  records which rows were draft beforehand, so a repaired row cannot afterwards
  be told apart from one submitted normally.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 16 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/session_report_status.test.sql`, run against the old
  function body as a negative control where five of them fail — including the
  standing invariant that no report is left as a draft while holding a
  completion reward.
  **Pushed 2026-09-22** on a fresh cold-verified backup, `20260922-204443`
  (plaintext SHA-256 `176C33C3E4DCEBB2FDFFF9D67FAEA60E0528722BCF7B6C45A296FDAC295240F6`,
  cold verification passed in a separate process at 18:45:13Z). The data-changing
  tier earned that fresh backup even though the DML turned out to be a no-op --
  see below -- because the tier follows what the file *can* do, not what it
  happens to do on the day.
  **The backfill matched zero rows.** Both reconnaissance queries run against
  hosted before the push returned nothing: no `session_reports` row sat at
  `status='draft'` beside a `session_report_rewards` row, and no survey was
  open. The originally reported "Draft - Reward paid" row had evidently been
  re-submitted in the meantime, which restores the status and leaves the reward
  alone. So on hosted this migration is **preventive, not corrective**: it closed
  the path rather than repairing damage, and no already-finalized session needed
  the replay that was deliberately declined. The join in the reconnaissance query
  could not have hidden a row -- `session_reports.session_id` and `player_id` are
  both `not null` with `on delete restrict` foreign keys.
  After the push, `migration list --linked` shows 67 entries with none pending and
  no remote-only drift, `20260927000000` Local = Remote, and the catalogue check
  reports 67 approved source migrations. Smoke-tested on hosted: the deployed
  function body contains `v_intent` (`prosrc like '%v_intent%'` is true), so the
  fix is in the running definition and not merely in the ledger, and the standing
  invariant still counts zero reports left at `draft` while holding a completion
  reward. The end-to-end check &mdash; submit, then confirm the RPC refuses a
  draft &mdash; waits for the next published session, since no survey was open.
- `20260928000000_active_member_projection_gate.sql` (**applied 2026-09-22**):
  KUT's ADR-079, merged in KUT PR #92 (`84de167`), closing KB-017 — a Supabase Security Advisor
  finding. Ten `security_invoker = false` views in the `kut` schema grant
  `SELECT` to this project's shared `authenticated` role and deliberately
  bypass their source tables' RLS, but none proved the caller is a KUT member.
  **This is the cross-tool boundary that matters for a shared project**: a JWT
  issued by another VibeTrunk tool is `authenticated` here too, so it could
  read member-only names, market and activity data, Club Values, ratings and
  Chronicle results through the Data API, as could a disabled KUT account with
  a still-valid session. A bounded read disclosure — these are read
  projections and `anon` has no `SELECT` on any of them.
  **DDL**: one new `kut.is_active_member()` (`sql`, `stable`,
  `security definer`, `search_path = kut, pg_catalog`, execute revoked from
  `public`/`anon` and granted to `authenticated`/`service_role`) plus ten
  `create or replace view`. `security definer` is required because
  `kut.profiles` RLS lets a member read only their own row, so invoker rights
  could never prove a *foreign* caller has no profile.
  **Zero DML**: no table created, altered or written, no backfill, no grant
  change — the grants in the file re-assert what each source migration already
  granted.
  **Nothing is flipped to `security_invoker = true`.** That is the Advisor's
  generic remedy and it is wrong for these views: they are cross-RLS club
  projections by design, and doing it to `kut.chronicle_session_reports` is
  precisely KUT's KB-013, the live Chronicle blackout of 2026-09-08.
  **Shape**: each view body is copied byte-identically from its source
  migration and wrapped as
  `select * from ( <body> ) gated where kut.is_active_member()`. The risk in
  this migration is transcription across ten bodies and six source files, not
  semantics, and the wrapper also makes it structurally impossible for
  `create or replace view` to change a column's name, order or type, since
  `select *` is expanded from an unchanged body. `EXPLAIN` shows
  `One-Time Filter: kut.is_active_member()`, so a denied caller never executes
  the body.
  `kut.public_live_ratings` additionally gains the explicit
  `security_invoker = false` it previously only inherited as the default.
  **Tier: additive, projection-only.** Rides the most recent scheduled backup.
  Must be its own push, separate from the data-changing `20260927000000`.
  **Reverse DDL** in the migration header: re-emit the ten bodies without the
  wrapper as `create or replace view` — never `drop view`, because
  `kut.my_club_value` depends on `kut.my_club_value_editions` — then
  `drop function kut.is_active_member();`. Grants are unchanged, so none need
  re-granting.
  **Operator note**: `kut.is_active_member()` is false for a bare psql session
  with no JWT and no `SET ROLE`. An ad-hoc query against any of these ten views
  from this repository's tooling needs `set role service_role;` first, or it
  will read zero rows and look like data loss when there is none.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 71 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/member_only_projections.test.sql` covering `anon`, a
  profileless JWT, a disabled member, an active participant, an active
  bystander and `service_role` across all ten views. Run against the ungated
  views as a negative control it fails 15 of them, matching KB-017's own
  accounting exactly.
  **Pushed 2026-09-22**, second of two separate pushes that evening and the
  additive one, so it rode the backup taken for `20260927000000`
  (`20260922-204443`) rather than a fresh one. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 68 entries with none pending and no
  remote-only drift, both `20260927000000` and `20260928000000` Local =
  Remote, and the catalogue check reports 68 approved source migrations.
  **Smoke-tested from the app as an ordinary member, which is the only test
  that matters here**: this migration's failure mode is not an error but an
  empty screen, exactly how KB-013 blacked out the Chronicle. Home (activity
  feed, Club Value, leaderboard), `/market`, `/leaderboard`, `/club/value`,
  `/market/offers` and a finalized Chronicle issue all rendered populated.
  Direct reads under `set role service_role` returned 21 rows from
  `kut.activity_feed` and 66 from `kut.chronicle_session_reports`, the latter
  consistent with three finalized surveys across the roster &mdash; so the
  cross-RLS projection the KB-013 fix restored is still whole.
- `20260929000000_season_rating_rules_rls.sql` (**applied 2026-09-23**):
  KUT's ADR-081, merged in KUT PR #98 (`25274ce`). This is the last
  open item from the 2026-09-16 Supabase Security Advisor review.
  `kut.season_rating_rules` (one row per season, its rating-v2 cutover week) was
  the only table in the `kut` schema with RLS disabled. It was not a write or
  integrity hole: `20260920070000` already grants only `SELECT`, to
  `authenticated` and `service_role`, and nothing to `anon`. But on this shared
  project a JWT issued by another VibeTrunk tool, or a disabled KUT account with
  a still-valid session, could read the cutover dates. That is the same
  cross-tool boundary as `20260928000000`, drawn with the same predicate.
  **DDL**: `alter table … enable row level security` plus one policy,
  `"active members read rating rules"`: `for select to authenticated using
  (kut.is_active_member())`. There is no write policy and no grant change, so
  writes stay refused by the missing grant with `42501`. The policy filters
  rather than raises. KUT's `/admin/attendance`, the one app reader, runs as an
  authenticated admin and passes it, and the service role has `BYPASSRLS`.
  **Zero DML.**
  **No `FORCE`.** The three `security definer` readers and writers are
  `kut._rebuild_season_core`, the `match_sessions_rating_version` trigger and
  the `seasons_initialize_rating_rules` trigger. They are owned by the table's
  owner and keep working through the owner bypass. Measured locally, `FORCE`
  would not break them either, because `postgres` carries `BYPASSRLS`. It is
  left off because it buys nothing and would rest those paths on a platform role
  attribute instead of on ownership.
  **Tier: additive, access-only.** Rides the most recent scheduled backup.
  **Reverse DDL** in the migration header:
  `drop policy "active members read rating rules" on kut.season_rating_rules;
  alter table kut.season_rating_rules disable row level security;`. Grants are
  unchanged, so none need re-granting.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 27 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/season_rating_rules_rls.test.sql`, covering `anon`, a
  profileless JWT, a disabled member, an active member, an admin, the service
  role, member writes, the three definer paths, and "no `kut` table has RLS
  disabled". Against the unmigrated schema, 7 of them fail as a negative
  control. After the migration the full KUT suite passes: 20 files, 630
  assertions.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: as an admin, `/admin/attendance` still
  explains the reporting cutover, and the next session still publishes and
  finalizes normally. The failure mode to watch for is silent: a denied read
  returns zero rows, not an error.
  **Pushed 2026-09-23** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #40 merged and this checkout was pulled to `c585c14`. Additive,
  so it rode the latest scheduled backup, `20260922-214356`, cold-verified.
  Before the push, `migration list --linked` showed 68 entries with
  `20260929000000` the only local-only one and no remote-only drift, the dry run
  named exactly that file, and the catalogue check reported 69 approved source
  migrations. Afterwards `migration list --linked` shows 69 entries, all present
  locally and remotely, with `20260929000000` on both sides.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor: `relrowsecurity = true`,
  `relforcerowsecurity = false`, the one policy exactly as written, and grants
  unchanged (`SELECT` for `authenticated` and `service_role`, nothing for
  `anon`). The schema-wide check returned no `kut` table without RLS. In the
  app, a superadmin on `/admin/attendance` still sees "This date uses member
  reports" for a post-cutover date. The page falls back to the admin-goals
  wording when the cutover is missing, so that is proof the admin read the row
  through the new policy, not merely the absence of an error. The remaining
  check, that the next session publishes and finalizes normally, waits for a
  real session.

- `20260930000000_injury_protection.sql` (**applied 2026-09-23**):
  KUT's ADR-082, merged in KUT PR #100 (`efa14df`). **Injury mode.** An admin
  puts a Player with an active account into injury mode. Each football week the
  Player sits out, the member does a rehab check-in: +100 KUT Coins, and that
  week's Activity carries over instead of decaying &times;0.90. Form still
  fades. Injury mode ends by itself when the Player attends a published session
  dated after the injury date. Protection is never backdated.
  **DDL**: tables `kut.injury_periods` (admin-read only; the note may hold
  medical detail) and `kut.injury_check_ins` (primary key
  `(player_id, week_start)`, the stipend's idempotency guard and the only fact
  the rebuild reads). Functions `kut._active_injury_period`,
  `kut._injury_checkable_week` (service role only), `kut.admin_start_injury`,
  `kut.admin_end_injury`, `kut.my_injury_status`, `kut.injury_check_in`. View
  `kut.injured_players` (definer, gated on `kut.is_active_member()`, never
  exposes the note). An `after update of status` trigger on
  `kut.match_sessions` sends an `injury_check_in` notice. `wallet_ledger`
  reasons gain `injury_stipend`, and `user_notifications` event types gain
  `injury_check_in`.
  **`kut._rebuild_season_core` is re-emitted** verbatim from `20260920000000`
  plus one protected-week guard. Rebuilding KUT's local data before and after
  gave zero differences in 29 players and 174 snapshots: output only changes
  once a check-in row exists.
  **Zero DML.**
  **Tier: data-changing.** It adds a new `wallet_ledger` reason and changes the
  rating engine, so it needs a fresh, cold-verified backup before the push.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header. It drops the trigger, view,
  functions and both tables, re-runs the `20260920000000` rebuild body, and
  narrows both check constraints after deleting any rows that use the new
  values.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 48 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/injury_protection.test.sql`. The full KUT suite
  passes: 21 files, 678 assertions. There was also a manual end-to-end pass on
  the local stack.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the new objects exist and the ledger
  and notification constraints carry the new values; `kut.injured_players`
  returns zero rows (nobody is injured yet); and KUT's `/admin/roster` shows
  the Injury column.
  **Pushed 2026-09-23** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #42 merged and this checkout was pulled to `304a618`.
  Data-changing, so it was preceded by a fresh backup,
  `20260923-105756`, cold-verified, with 0 escrowed cards. Before the push,
  `migration list --linked` showed 70 entries with `20260930000000` the only
  local-only one and no remote-only drift, the dry run named exactly that file,
  and the catalogue check reported 70 approved source migrations. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 70 entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed: both tables
  with RLS on, all six functions, the view and the trigger, `injury_stipend` and
  `injury_check_in` in their check constraints, the protected-week guard in
  `kut._rebuild_season_core`, no execute for `anon` on `kut.injury_check_in`,
  and zero injury periods. In the app, `/admin/roster` shows the Injury column

- `20261001000000_injury_comeback_form.sql` (**applied 2026-09-23**):
  KUT's ADR-083, merged in KUT PR #102 (`37e5af4`). **Comeback Form**, the
  second slice of injury mode. The first published v2 session a Player attends
  after an injury period with at least 3 protected weeks carries
  `least(2, 0.25 × protected_weeks)` Form. It ages like a session's
  goals-and-kudos input over the next four sessions and counts under the
  unchanged Form cap of 8. Only weeks before the return week count, only the
  first return counts, and periods ending in the same return are summed once.
  **DDL**: table `kut.comeback_form_inputs`, which holds derived rows.
  `kut._rebuild_season_core` deletes and re-derives them from
  `kut.injury_check_ins` and attendance on every rebuild, like
  `player_rating_snapshots`, and members read them under
  `kut.is_active_member()`. `kut._rebuild_season_core` is re-emitted from
  `20260930000000` with that derivation and a union into the v2 session
  inputs. `kut.player_form_contributions` is `create or replace`d to union the
  comeback rows in, with `source` and `protected_weeks` **appended**.
  **Zero DML.** Rebuilding KUT's local data before and after gave zero
  differences in 29 players and 174 snapshots; output only changes for a
  Player with an injury period, 3+ protected weeks and a return.
  **Tier: data-changing** (rating-formula change). It needs a fresh,
  cold-verified backup before the push. It depends on `20260930000000`, which is
  already applied.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header. `drop view
  kut.player_form_contributions` (create or replace cannot drop the appended
  columns), then re-run its `20260926000000` block, re-run the `20260930000000`
  rebuild body, drop the table and rebuild the active season.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 25 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/injury_comeback.test.sql`. Against the ADR-082 engine,
  15 of them fail as a negative control. The full KUT suite passes: 22 files,
  703 assertions.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the table (RLS on), the engine's
  comeback union, and the two appended view columns exist; the table is empty;
  and a card's "Why this rating" story still renders in the app.
  **Pushed 2026-09-23** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #44 merged and this checkout was pulled to `18a8b45`.
  Data-changing, so it was preceded by a fresh backup, `20260923-112450`,
  cold-verified, with 0 escrowed cards. Before the push,
  `migration list --linked` showed 71 entries with `20261001000000` the only
  local-only one and no remote-only drift, the dry run named exactly that file,
  and the catalogue check reported 71 approved source migrations. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 71 entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed: the table
  exists with RLS on and its one policy, `anon` has no select, it holds zero
  rows, the engine carries both the protected-week guard and the comeback
  union, and the view has both appended columns. In the app, a Live card's
  "Why this rating" story (Freek) still lists its sessions, which sum to the
  stated Form total, through the new `select("*")` read.

- `20261002000000_cast_on_market_and_packs.sql` (**applied 2026-09-23**):
  KUT's ADR-086, merged in KUT PR #108 (`72ffb70`). The market and
  pack openings carry the card's Player, so an injured Player's Live card shows
  the plaster cast there too (ADR-084, ADR-085).
  **DDL**: `kut.active_market_listings` and `kut.my_pack_opening_results` are
  `create or replace`d with `player_id` and `is_live` **appended** as their last
  two columns, both from `kut.card_editions`. Each body is copied from its
  latest version (`20260928000000` and `20260902000000` block 5); the only new
  text is the two appended columns. Access is unchanged: the market view keeps
  its `kut.is_active_member()` gate, and the pack view stays a
  `security_invoker` view over the member's own openings.
  `kut.my_wanted_cards` depends on the market view, which is why this never
  drops it.
  **Zero DML. Tier: additive**, so it rides the latest scheduled backup.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header and optional, since the extra
  columns do no harm to any reader. It drops and re-runs
  `kut.my_wanted_cards` and `kut.active_market_listings` (from `20260928000000`
  and `20260920060000`) and `kut.my_pack_opening_results` (from
  `20260902000000` block 5).
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT's pages read both views with `select("*")` and
  shipped on merge. Until this push they render with no cast, which was checked
  locally against the old views.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 26 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/cast_on_market_and_packs.test.sql`. Run against the
  old views as a negative control, its six schema assertions fail and its first
  value query errors. The full KUT suite passes: 23 files, 729 assertions.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: both views end in `player_id,
  is_live`; the market view is still definer with the gate and the pack view
  still invoker; `anon` has no select on either; and `/market` renders
  normally.
  **Pushed 2026-09-23** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #46 merged and this checkout was pulled to `1451142`.
  Additive, so it rode the latest scheduled backup, `20260923-112450`,
  cold-verified, with 0 escrowed cards. Before the push,
  `migration list --linked` showed 72 entries with `20261002000000` the only
  local-only one and no remote-only drift, the dry run named exactly that file,
  and the catalogue check reported 72 approved source migrations. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 72 entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed: both views
  end in `player_id, is_live`; the market view is still
  `security_invoker=false` with the `kut.is_active_member()` gate and the pack
  view still `security_invoker=true`; `anon` has no select on either; and
  `kut.my_wanted_cards` still resolves. In the app, `/market` loads normally.
  No Player is in injury mode on hosted today, so the cast itself can't be
  seen there yet.

- `20261003000000_midweek_entry.sql` (**applied 2026-09-25**): KUT's
  Midweek Madness migration A (BUILD_SPEC §44.14; ADR-089, ADR-091), merged in
  KUT PR #120 (`df6a0b6`). Midweek Madness is a weekly 5-card squad knockout;
  this migration adds only what a member needs to enter. The engine, worker,
  reveal views and payouts follow as their own migrations (ADR-070).
  **DDL**: six new tables, all with RLS on, everything revoked from `public`,
  `anon` and `authenticated`, and `select` for `service_role` only:
  `kut.midweek_config` (a single-row launch switch, `enabled` default false),
  `kut.midweek_tournaments`, `kut.midweek_tournament_secrets` (the seed,
  ADR-091), `kut.midweek_squads`, `kut.midweek_squad_cards` and
  `kut.midweek_opt_outs`. Two definer RPCs, `kut.save_midweek_squad(uuid[])`
  and `kut.set_midweek_opt_out(boolean)`, executable by `authenticated` and
  `service_role` only. Three definer views gated on `kut.is_active_member()`
  (ADR-079), `kut.midweek_current`, `kut.midweek_tournaments_public` and
  `kut.my_midweek_squad`, selectable by `authenticated` and `service_role`
  only.
  **DML**: one insert, the switch row `(true, false)` into the new
  `kut.midweek_config`. No existing row is touched and no coin moves. **Tier:
  additive**, so it rides the latest scheduled backup.
  **Nothing goes live with it**: nothing creates a tournament until the engine
  migration's worker ships, and the switch starts off.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header: drop the three views, the two
  functions and the six tables.
  **Deploy ordering**: no KUT page reads these objects yet, so the merge
  deployed ahead of the push is harmless.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 89 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/midweek_entry.test.sql` (the access matrix on every
  table, view and function; every refusal code; squads private before the
  lock; opt-out; the lock). CI's database job passed on KUT PR #120.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the six tables exist with RLS on; the
  switch row is present and off; no tournament exists; `anon` and
  `authenticated` can read none of the tables and `anon` none of the views;
  `anon` can execute neither RPC; and the three views are definer and gated.
  **Pushed 2026-09-25** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #48 merged and this checkout was pulled to `8bc80ae`.
  Additive, so it rode the latest scheduled backup, `20260923-112450`,
  cold-verified, with 0 escrowed cards. Before the push,
  `migration list --linked` showed 73 entries with `20261003000000` the only
  local-only one and no remote-only drift, the dry run named exactly that file,
  and the catalogue check reported 73 approved source migrations. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 73 entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed all of the
  above: `6/6 | 1:true | 0 | false | false | false | 3/3`. There is nothing to
  see in the app yet.

- `20261004000000_archetype_cooldown.sql` (**applied 2026-09-25**):
  KUT's Midweek Madness migration B (BUILD_SPEC §44.2, §44.14; ADR-089,
  ADR-094), merged in KUT PR #122 (`f15f072`). A member may change their own
  Player's archetype at most once every 14 days, because the archetype shapes
  a Midweek squad's lines.
  **DDL**: one nullable column, `kut.players.archetype_changed_at timestamptz`,
  with no default and a comment. `create or replace` of
  `kut.set_own_player_archetype(text)`, whose body is copied from
  `20260906000000` plus the guard: it locks the Player row, refuses a change
  within 336 hours of the stamp (`22023`, next allowed moment in the DETAIL),
  and stamps `now()` on an actual change. Re-saving the current archetype is
  neither refused nor stamped. Grants unchanged: revoked from `public` and
  `anon`, granted to `authenticated`.
  **DML**: none. Nothing is backfilled, so every member's first change is
  allowed. **Tier: additive**, so it rides the latest scheduled backup.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header: re-create the function from
  `20260906000000`, then drop the column.
  **Deploy ordering**: `/settings/card` reads the new column in its own query
  and treats a missing column as "never changed", so the merge deployed ahead
  of the push is harmless. The rule applies from the push.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 28 pgTAP assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/archetype_cooldown.test.sql` (the first change,
  the refusal and its DETAIL, the same-archetype re-save, both edges of the
  window, the admin path, the other refusals unchanged). CI's database job
  passed on KUT PR #122.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the column is a nullable timestamptz
  with no default, no Player is stamped yet, the function is definer and
  carries the guard, `anon` cannot execute it and `authenticated` can.
  **Pushed 2026-09-25** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #50 merged and this checkout was pulled to `5285e29`.
  Additive, so it rode the latest scheduled backup, `20260923-112450`,
  cold-verified. Before the push, `migration list --linked` showed 74 entries
  with `20261004000000` the only local-only one and no remote-only drift, the
  dry run named exactly that file, and the catalogue check reported 74
  approved source migrations. Afterwards `migration list --linked` shows 74
  entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed all of the

- `20261005000000_midweek_engine.sql` (**applied 2026-09-26**):
  KUT's Midweek Madness migration C (BUILD_SPEC §44.3–§44.11, §44.14; Part L
  #25; ADR-090, ADR-091, ADR-095), merged in KUT PR #125 (`51a08e8`). The
  engine, the lazy worker, the stored result, the reveal projections and the
  admin controls. No coins: payouts come in the next migration.
  **DDL**: the engine as internal `kut._mm_*` functions (a port of KUT's
  TypeScript twin, pinned by a generated pgTAP parity test), revoked from
  `public`, `anon` and `authenticated`. Six tables with RLS on and only
  `service_role` select: `midweek_entries`, `midweek_entry_cards`,
  `midweek_pick_shares`, `midweek_matches`, `midweek_match_events`,
  `midweek_jobs`. Two nullable columns on `kut.midweek_tournaments`
  (`voided_at`, `voided_by`). Eight guard triggers for Part L #25 (results
  written once and never changed, a tournament only moves forward, squads
  immutable after the lock). The service-role worker
  `kut.run_midweek_due(integer)`. Five new definer views gated on
  `kut.is_active_member()` and on time (the admin overview on
  `kut.is_admin()`), and `create or replace` of
  `kut.midweek_tournaments_public` appending `champion_user_id` and
  `champion_name` at the end. Admin RPCs `admin_set_midweek_enabled`,
  `admin_void_midweek` and `admin_midweek_rehearsal`, granted to
  `authenticated` and `service_role` and checked with `kut.is_admin()` inside.
  **DML**: none. The worker writes only once a tournament exists, which needs
  the switch, still off on hosted. **Tier: additive**, so it rides the latest
  scheduled backup, `20260923-112450`, cold-verified.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header (switch off, no tournament
  simulated): drop the admin functions, the new views, re-create the tournament
  list from `20261003000000`, drop the worker, the triggers, the six tables and
  the two columns, then the `_mm_*` functions.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #125 has no UI, so the merge deployed ahead of
  the push is harmless.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 160 parity assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/midweek_engine_parity.test.sql` and 147 in
  `midweek_engine.test.sql` (access matrix, worker lifecycle and gates, lock
  snapshot, reveal timing, owner counts, a second call changing nothing, the
  #25 guards, void, a rehearsal that writes nothing, the switch and the open
  step), plus `tests/integration/midweek-race.test.ts` (three concurrent
  worker calls). CI's database job passed on KUT PR #125.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the six tables and five views exist,
  the tournament list ends with `champion_name`, all eight guards are in place,
  only `service_role` can run the worker, members cannot run the engine, the
  engine reproduces a golden draw and a golden lock time (so the hosted time
  zone data agrees), the switch is off and no tournament exists.
  **Pushed 2026-09-26** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #52 merged and this checkout was pulled to `93c9a57`.

  Nothing pays until the switch is turned on at launch.
  KUT's Midweek Madness migration D (BUILD_SPEC §44.7, §44.14; Part L #26;
  ADR-096), merged in KUT PR #127 (`282ea1c`). The payouts: every match won
  pays coins by round, a bye as a round-1 win, and a champion collects 250.
  **DDL**: `wallet_ledger_reason_check` re-created with `midweek_win` and
  `user_notifications_event_type_check` with `midweek_result` (drop by lookup,
  full lists copied from `20260930000000`). New table `kut.midweek_rewards`
  (primary key `(tournament_id, round_no, user_id)`, unique `match_id`,
  deferred `ledger_id`; RLS on, only `service_role` select) with the Part L #26
  guard trigger `midweek_rewards_guard`. Internal `kut._mm_pay_tournament(uuid)`
  (revoked from `public`, `anon`, `authenticated`); `create or replace` of
  `kut._mm_complete_tournament(uuid)` so the worker pays before a week
  completes, in one transaction. New definer view `kut.my_midweek_rewards`
  gated on `kut.is_active_member()`, granted to `authenticated` and
  `service_role`.
  **DML**: none. Nothing pays until a tournament exists, which needs the
  switch, still off on hosted. **Tier: data-changing** (a new coin faucet and
  a widened ledger constraint), so it took a fresh backup,
  `20260926-052453`, cold-verified.
  **Reverse DDL** is in the migration header (switch off, nothing simulated or
  completed since): re-create `_mm_complete_tournament` from
  `20261005000000`, drop the view, `_mm_pay_tournament`, the trigger, its
  function and the table, then re-create both constraints from
  `20260930000000` once no row uses the new values.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #127 labels `midweek_result` in the inbox and
  adds a constant; neither depends on the schema, so the merge deployed ahead
  of the push is harmless.
  Verified in the KUT repository: 63 assertions in
  `supabase/tests/database/midweek_payouts.test.sql` (every win paid once at
  its round's amount, the champion's 250 in brackets of 16, 8 and 4, byes,
  ledger equals wallet moves, one message per member paid, a second call pays
  nothing, the guard, void after payout refused, the member view), and
  `tests/integration/midweek-race.test.ts` (three concurrent worker calls pay
  once). CI's database job passed on KUT PR #127.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: RLS on the rewards table, the member

  The owner then switched Midweek Madness on from `/admin/midweek`, which
  the fix made possible; the first week locks Wed 30 Sep 2026 20:00.
  KUT's fix for KB-024 (BUILD_SPEC §44.8; ADR-095), merged in KUT PR #131
  (`35fbe02`). The Midweek launch switch failed on hosted:
  `kut.admin_set_midweek_enabled` updated the single-row
  `kut.midweek_config` without a `WHERE`, and PostgREST's `authenticator`
  role preloads `safeupdate`, which rejects that (SQLSTATE 21000). The
  database suites connect as `postgres` and never load it.
  **DDL**: `create or replace` of `kut.admin_set_midweek_enabled(boolean)`
  with `where id`, otherwise identical (checks, errors, grants, return value).
  **DML**: none. **Tier: additive**; the fresh cold-verified backup
  `20260926-102414`, taken for the Midweek launch, also covers it.
  **Reverse DDL**: re-create the function from `20261005000000` section 6
  (the switch is then unusable through the API again).
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #131 changes no app code, so the merge deployed
  ahead of the push is harmless.
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_switch.test.sql`
  (no `kut` function updates or deletes without a `WHERE`; the switch on, off
  and refused to a member) and `tests/integration/midweek-switch.test.ts`
  (the switch called as `authenticator`, as the API does; it fails on the old
  function). CI's database job passed on KUT PR #131.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the function names its row, no `kut`
  function writes without a `WHERE`, `anon` cannot execute it and
  `authenticated` can, it is still security definer, and the switch is still
  off with no tournament.

  The first week (locking Wed 30 Sep 2026 20:00) is snapshotted.
  KUT's Midweek archetype snapshot (BUILD_SPEC §44.2, §44.11;
  ADR-099), merged in KUT PR #133 (`77357bf`). The lock read each card's
  archetype live, so a member could change their own archetype just before
  the lock and reshape squads others had already picked. Archetypes are now
  frozen when a week opens; OVR, injuries and ownership are still read live
  at the lock.
  **DDL**: new table `kut.midweek_archetype_snapshots` (primary key
  `(tournament_id, player_id)`, both cascading; RLS on, only `service_role`
  select). Internal `kut._mm_snapshot_archetypes()` (revoked from `public`,
  `anon`, `authenticated`) behind the `after insert` trigger
  `midweek_tournament_archetype_snapshot` on `kut.midweek_tournaments`.
  `create or replace` of `kut._mm_field(uuid, timestamptz)`, reading
  `coalesce(snapshot.archetype, player.archetype)`, otherwise identical. New
  definer view `kut.midweek_archetypes` gated on `kut.is_active_member()`,
  granted to `authenticated` and `service_role`.
  **DML**: backfills the week open at the push (2026-09-28, locking Wed 30
  Sep 20:00) with every Player's archetype as it stands then, into the new
  table only. **Tier: data-changing** (a backfill, and the lock reads a new
  source), so it took a fresh backup, `20260926-154520`, cold-verified.
  **Reverse DDL**: re-create `kut._mm_field` from `20261005000000` section 4,
  then drop the view, the trigger, the function and the table.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #133 deployed ahead of the push; the picker
  tolerates the missing view and falls back to the live archetype, which is
  what the lock reads until the push.
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_archetype_snapshot.test.sql`
  (19: the snapshot at open, a change after the open leaves it alone, member
  and disabled-member reads, the fallback for a Player created after the
  open, the lock plays the snapshot, the next week picks up the change) and

  Read-only pre-checks from this branch: `migration list --linked` shows 78
  entries with `20261008000000` the only local-only one and no remote-only
  drift; the dry run would push exactly that file; the catalogue check
  reports 78 approved source migrations.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push** (as `service_role`): the open week is
  2026-09-28, every Player has a snapshot row for it matching their live
  archetype, the trigger is enabled, `_mm_field` reads the snapshot,
  `authenticated` reads the view but not the table, `anon` reads neither, and
  there is one tournament. The local run returned
  `2026-09-28 | t | t | t | t | t | f | f | 1`.

- `20261009000000_goals_assists_notice_copy.sql` (**applied 2026-09-27**):
  **Pushed 2026-09-27** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #60 merged (`b747621`). Additive; the fresh backup
  `20260927-180300` was taken anyway, cold-verified. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 79 entries, all present locally and
  remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor as `service_role`, one row
  confirmed all of the smoke checks below, identical to the local run:
  `false | true | true | true | true | true | true | true | false | false | false`.
  KUT's goals + assists report (BUILD_SPEC §8, §15.2 and the
  2026-09-27 amendment; ADR-101), merged in KUT PR #137 (`86bd248`). From the
  football week beginning 2026-09-28 a member reports one combined goals +
  assists count ("G+A"); earlier sessions keep meaning goals. The pages carry
  the wording themselves; this migration changes only the notices SQL writes.
  **DDL**: new immutable `kut._uses_combined_count(date)` (`date >=
  2026-09-28`; revoked from `public` and `anon`, executable by
  `service_role`). `create or replace` of `kut._open_session_survey()`
  (report-open title "Goals + Assists & kudos"), `kut._finalize_one_session(uuid)`
  (results body "Reported G+A and recognized kudos are now in the
  Chronicle."; kudos body "Your 4 G+A and these kudos ...") and
  `kut.admin_correct_session_goals(uuid,uuid,integer,boolean,text)` ("Reported
  G+A corrected", "the effective G+A total"), each only for a session dated on
  or after 2026-09-28 and otherwise verbatim from its latest body (locking,
  scoring, rebuild, `on conflict do nothing`, security definer and
  `search_path` unchanged; the grants are restated as they were).
  **DML**: none. Notices already written keep their wording. **Tier:
  additive** (function bodies and one new function), so it rides on the
  latest backup; a fresh one was taken anyway because the first G+A session is
  on 28 Sep: `20260927-180300`, cold-verified (one card escrowed in an open
  offer, recorded in the backup log).
  **Reverse DDL**: re-run the `kut._finalize_one_session` block from
  `20260925000000` and the `kut._open_session_survey` and
  `kut.admin_correct_session_goals` blocks from `20260920000000` as
  `create or replace`, then drop `kut._uses_combined_count(date)`.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #137 deploys on merge and needs nothing new from
  the database. Until this push, notices for sessions from 28 Sep are written
  in the goals wording and keep it, so push before the 28 Sep session is
  published, or at the latest before its 24-hour report window closes.
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/goals_assists_cutover.test.sql`
  (48: every notice on a 27 Sep and a 28 Sep session, the unchanged 0 / 1 /
  1.25 / 1.5 ladder, the 3.5 session cap, Form 8, Live OVR 83, SHO +8) and the
  full database suite (1291). CI passed on KUT PR #137.
  Read-only pre-checks from this branch: `migration list --linked` shows 79

  reports 79 approved source migrations.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push** (as `service_role`): 27 Sep is not G+A
  and 28 Sep is; the three functions carry the new wording and are still
  security definer; the report-open trigger is enabled; `authenticated` can
  run the admin correction but neither `_finalize_one_session` nor the
  helper; `anon` cannot run the correction. The local run returned
  `f | t | t | t | t | t | t | t | f | f | f`.

  **Pushed 2026-09-30** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #62 merged (`c75bae2`). Additive; the fresh backup
  `20260930-163158` was taken anyway, cold-verified. Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 80 entries, all present locally and
  remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor as `service_role`, one row
  confirmed all of the smoke checks below, matching the local run apart from
  the live listing count:
  `discard_value | {security_invoker=false,security_barrier=true} | true | false | 15 | 0 | 0`.
  KUT's market discard value (KB-027, BUILD_SPEC §36, ADR-103),
  merged in KUT PR #140 (`6553f24`). The listing detail page shows what a
  listed card discards for, as the floor to judge its asking price against.
  **DDL**: `create or replace view kut.active_market_listings` with its
  `20261002000000` body verbatim and one column appended last, inside the
  ADR-079 `is_active_member()` wrapper: `discard_value`, which calls
  `kut.card_discard_value(card.id)` only when the card has a rating
  (`coalesce(snapshot_ovr, live_ovr) is not null`) and is null otherwise,
  because the function raises P0002 for an unrated card. The view stays
  `security_invoker = false`, `security_barrier = true`; its revoke/grant is
  restated unchanged. `grant execute on function kut.card_discard_value(uuid)
  to authenticated, service_role`: a function inside a view is checked against
  the caller even in a definer view, so without it every member and
  service-role read of the view (and of `kut.my_wanted_cards`) fails. A small
  access change, recorded in ADR-103; `anon` stays revoked.
  **DML**: none. **Tier: additive** (a view gains a trailing column, plus one
  function grant), so it rides on the latest backup; a fresh one was taken
  anyway: `20260930-163158`, cold-verified, no cards in escrow.
  **Reverse DDL**: `drop view kut.my_wanted_cards; drop view
  kut.active_market_listings;`, re-run the `kut.active_market_listings` block
  of `20261002000000` (with its revoke/grant), then the whole of
  `20260920060000`; then `revoke execute on function
  kut.card_discard_value(uuid) from authenticated, service_role;`. The column
  is harmless to every reader, so rolling back is optional.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #140 deployed on merge. The page reads the view
  with `select("*")` and renders nothing while the column is absent, so until
  this push the listing page simply has no discard line.
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/market_listing_card_art.test.sql`
  (21: the column comes last, reloptions unchanged, the function grants, Live
  160 and Special 120 equal `card_discard_value`, an unrated card stays listed
  with null, a profileless and a disabled caller read 0 rows, `anon` is refused,
  `service_role` still reads the view and `my_wanted_cards`) and the full
  database suite (1307). CI passed on KUT PR #140.
  Read-only pre-checks from this branch: `migration list --linked` shows 80

  reports 80 approved source migrations.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push** (as `service_role`): `discard_value` is
  the last column; the view keeps `{security_invoker=false,security_barrier=true}`;
  `authenticated` can execute `card_discard_value` and `anon` cannot; then the
  listing count, how many have a null value, and how many disagree with the
  function (must be 0). The local run returned
  `discard_value | {security_invoker=false,security_barrier=true} | t | f | 0 | 0 | 0`.

- `20261011000000_midweek_evening_timing.sql` (**applied 2026-10-02**):
  **Pushed 2026-10-02** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #64 merged (`a8e71fb`), on the fresh backup `20261002-091630`.
  The KUT production gate passed beforehand for candidate `5da5dd8` (KUT #147
  plus the KB-032 layout fix #148, which unblocked the gate's E2E). Afterwards
  `migration list --linked` shows 81 entries, all present locally and remotely.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row confirmed all of the
  smoke checks below; the open week of 5 Oct moved to version 2 and now locks
  Wednesday 19:55, and the one past week stays on version 1:
  `2 | 3 | true | 2 | 2026-10-05 v2 Wed 19:55 | 1 | 0 | 0 | schedule_version`.
  KUT's Midweek Madness evening on a versioned clock (MM 2.0 B1,
  BUILD_SPEC §44.1, §44.7, §44.11, §44.14, §145, Part L #25, ADR-104), merged
  in KUT PR #147 (`199b126`). Squads lock Wednesday 19:55, round r starts at
  `lock + 5 + 15 × (r − 1)` minutes, and the payout waits for the end of the
  final. **DDL**: `kut._mm_config()` re-created with `schedule = {lockDayOffset,
  current: 2, versions: {1, 2}}` (every other key unchanged); new internal
  `kut._mm_schedule(int)`, `kut._mm_lock_at(date, int)`,
  `kut._mm_round_start_at(timestamptz, int, int)`, `kut._mm_match_timing(jsonb,
  int)`; `kut._mm_lock_at(date)` re-created to mean the current version;
  `kut._mm_reveal_at(timestamptz, integer)` dropped. `kut.midweek_tournaments`
  gains `schedule_version smallint not null` (check 1–2; existing rows 1, then
  default 2), `kut.midweek_matches` gains `ends_at` (check `>= reveal_at`),
  `kut.midweek_match_events` gains `reveal_at`, all nullable on rows already
  simulated. Re-created: `kut._mm_guard_tournament` (the version is fixed once a
  week locks), `kut._mm_lock_tournament` (stores each match's start and end and
  each event's time; `final_reveal_at` = the end of the final),
  `kut._mm_open_next` (names the current version),
  `kut.admin_midweek_rehearsal` (the week's clock, each round's `ends_at`,
  `schedule_version`). `kut.midweek_current` and
  `kut.midweek_tournaments_public` re-created with `schedule_version` appended
  last, definer mode, barrier and member gate unchanged. Every `kut._mm_*`
  function revoked from public, anon and authenticated again.
  **DML**: the open tournament moves to version 2, its lock from 20:00 to 19:55
  Amsterdam, unless 19:55 has already passed. **Tier: data-changing** (it
  re-times the open week's lock and changes when the payout runs): fresh backup
  `20261002-091630`, cold-verified, no cards in escrow.
  **Reverse DDL**: in the migration's header (move an open version-2 week back
  first, then re-create the views from `20261003000000`/`20261005000000` and the
  functions from `20261005000000`, drop the four new functions, the three
  columns).
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #147 deployed on merge. The pages read both views
  with `select("*")` and treat a row without `schedule_version` as version 1,
  which every hosted week is until this push; the payout functions are
  unchanged and simply wait for `final_reveal_at`.
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_evening_timing.test.sql`
  (42: the clock in summer and winter time, the open step, version-2 starts,
  ends and event times, payout refused while the final plays and paid after,
  version 1 side by side, the guards, the views, the rehearsal), the regenerated
  `midweek_engine_parity.test.sql` (190: SQL and TypeScript clocks agree, no
  engine result changed), every other database suite (engine and payouts now
  pin version 1) and CI on KUT PR #147.
  Read-only pre-checks from this branch: `migration list --linked` shows 81

  81 approved source migrations.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the current version, the three new
  columns, the old reveal function gone, the column default, the open week with
  its version and Amsterdam lock time, past weeks on version 1 and on any other
  version, matches with a stored end (0 until the next lock), and the tournament
  list's last column. The local run, with an open week of 5 Oct, returned
  `2 | 3 | t | 2 | 2026-10-05 v2 Wed 19:55 | 0 | 0 | 0 | schedule_version`.

  catalogue PR #66 merged (`871f121`), on the fresh backup `20261002-110621`.
  The KUT production gate passed beforehand for candidate `2f3a94a` (KUT #152
  plus the Compete navigation #153). The post-push `migration list` was not
  re-run; the smoke row's first column confirms the version is recorded.
  **Smoke-tested on hosted.** In the SQL editor, one row matched the local run
  exactly:
  `true | security_invoker=false,security_barrier=true | true | 10 | 26 | true | evening_live | true`.
  What KUT members may read of a Midweek Madness week from the lock
  (MM 2.0 B2, BUILD_SPEC §44.9, §44.14, ADR-105), merged in KUT PR #152
  (`b62c913`). **Views only.** New `kut.midweek_draw_public` (definer, barrier,
  gated on `kut.is_active_member()`; round 1's pairings and byes, both managers
  and `kickoff_at` from the lock, no result column; select to authenticated and

  columns: `kut.midweek_entries_public`, now from the lock instead of round 1,
  with `form_roll_ppm`, `pick_factor_ppm` and `power_ppm` null until round 1
  kicks off. Re-created: `kut.midweek_tournaments_public` and
  `kut.midweek_current` with `final_reveal_at` null until it has passed (since
  ADR-104 it is the end of the final, which at the lock told an API reader
  whether the final goes to penalties); `kut.midweek_current` appends
  `evening_live`. Definer mode, barrier and member gate unchanged throughout.
  **No DML. Tier: additive** (views only); fresh backup anyway for the release
  gate: `20261002-110621`, cold-verified, no cards in escrow.
  **Reverse DDL**: in the migration's header (drop the draw view; re-create the

  from `20261003000000`).
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #152 deployed on merge, then KUT PR #153 (the

  `kut._mm_pay_tournament(uuid)` (same signature, security definer, internal:
  revoked from public, anon and authenticated, as before). **The payment part
  is unchanged word for word** (rewards, ledger rows, wallets, return value;
  Part L #26 untouched). Only its message step changes: one `midweek_result`
  per entrant not disabled, titled by finish ("You won Midweek Madness", "You
  went out in the quarter-finals"), with who beat them and how, their coins if
  any, the champion (not on the runner-up's) and, for an auto squad, "Your auto
  squad played for you." The reference stays the tournament. Idempotent through
  the inbox's unique index, as before.
  **No DML at push time. Tier: data-changing** (it changes what the worker
  writes when it pays a week): fresh cold-verified backup before the push.
  **Reverse DDL**: re-create `kut._mm_pay_tournament` from

  day rolls from kick-off, but shows goals, penalties, `winner_side` and
  `winner_user_id` only once the match has ended; it appends `ends_at` (null
  until passed: a late end gives a shoot-out away) and `in_play`.
  `kut.midweek_events_public` shows each event from its own `reveal_at` and
  appends it. `kut.midweek_tournaments_public` names the champion from the end
  of the final. Weeks simulated before ADR-104 have no stored times and still
  show whole matches at kick-off. All three stay definer views with a barrier,

  advisory lock and a second running-week check, then the rotation with the new
  week's secret seed right before the tournament insert, so the ADR-099
  snapshot freezes it, each change logged against the new week; a clash on
  `week_start` now raises instead of `on conflict do nothing`.

  `/settings/card` copy, which reads nothing new. The week open at the push
  keeps its archetypes; the first rotation runs when the worker opens the
  following week. Not to be pushed while a Wednesday evening is running (lock
  to payout).
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_archetype_rotation.test.sql`
  (34), every other database suite, `tests/integration/midweek-rotation.test.ts`
  (three worker calls racing through `authenticator` with safeupdate loaded),
  authenticated E2E, and CI on KUT PR #170.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the version recorded, the log's RLS and
  grants, a fixed draw, the open step's lock-rotate-log order, no execute grant
  on the rotation, an empty log and the open week. The local run returned
  `t | t | f | t | tank | t | f | 0 |` (no week open locally; hosted should end
  in the open week, `2026-10-05`).

- `20261016000000_midweek_balance.sql` (**applied 2026-10-03**):
  **Pushed 2026-10-03** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #75 merged (`0832f6f`), on the fresh backup `20261003-122258`.
  The KUT production gate passed beforehand for candidate `b96ee52`. A dry
  run from the merged main just before the push named only this file; no
  evening was running (Saturday). After the push `migration list --linked`
  showed 86 local and 86 remote, no drift. **Hosted smoke test:** the owner
  ran the one-row query (in KUT's `docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md`) in the SQL editor and
  confirmed it matched the local run below, with the open week `2026-10-05` in
  the last column. That week (Wed 7 Oct) is
  the first played under the new balance.
  Balanced squads beat All-rounders (MM 2.0 PR 8, C2, BUILD_SPEC §44.3-§44.5,
  §44.12, §44.14, §145, ADR-116 amending ADR-089 and ADR-092; owner Q13
  interview and tuning sign-off 2026-10-03), merged in KUT PR #172
  (`b96ee52`). Each archetype's plusses per line become the engine's input:
  re-creates `kut._mm_config()` (the plusses table, line values, the
  weakest-line rule, `keeperPpm`, `match.defenceWeightPpm`, OVR factor 1.12,
  auto factor 0.55), `kut._mm_lines`, `kut._mm_play_match`,
  `kut._mm_simulate` and `kut._mm_lock_tournament`; adds
  `kut._mm_balance(text[], integer)` (internal, no grants) and
  `kut.midweek_entries.balance_ppm` (nullable; null on every week already
  locked); re-creates `kut.midweek_entries_public` with `balance_ppm` appended.
  No invariant changes.
  **No DML at the push. Tier: data-changing** (it changes what the lock step
  computes and so who is paid): fresh cold-verified backup before the push.
  **Reverse DDL**: drop and re-create `kut.midweek_entries_public` from
  `20261012000000_midweek_draw_from_lock.sql`; re-create
  `kut._mm_lock_tournament` and `kut._mm_config` from
  `20261011000000_midweek_evening_timing.sql`; re-create `kut._mm_lines`,
  `kut._mm_play_match` and `kut._mm_simulate` from
  `20261005000000_midweek_engine.sql`; drop `kut._mm_balance(text[], integer)`
  and `kut.midweek_entries.balance_ppm`. Weeks locked on the new engine keep
  their stored results.
  **Deploy ordering**: KUT PR #172's pages read `midweek_entries_public` with
  `select("*")` and treat a missing or null `balance_ppm` as no balance chip,
  so they work before the push. The week open at the push locks on the new
  rules (owner: switch at the push). Not to be pushed while a Wednesday evening
  is running (lock to payout).
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_balance.test.sql`
  (23), the regenerated `midweek_engine_parity.test.sql` (199), every other
  database suite (36 files, 1,528 assertions), the midweek integration suites,
  `npm run sim:midweek` at 5,000 seasons, authenticated E2E, and CI on KUT PR
  #172.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the version recorded, the rule's
  threshold, the Tank's plusses, the OVR factor, a one-line stack's balance,
  a Finisher's lines, the view's last column, no member execute grant on the
  rule, no balanced entries yet and the open week. The local run returned
  `t | 3 | [0, 2, 2] | 1120000 | 681472 | [2000000, 1000000, 200000] | balance_ppm | f | 0 |`
  (no week open locally; hosted should end in the open week, `2026-10-05`).

- `20261017000000_midweek_predictions.sql` (**applied 2026-10-03**):
  **Pushed 2026-10-03** from this repository, on its own `db push`, after
  catalogue PR #77 merged (`aa52104`), on the fresh backup `20261003-134420`.
  The KUT production gate passed beforehand for candidate `9a029e6` (its first
  run failed closed on a passing clock skew between Windows and the Docker VM;
  the rerun passed). A dry run from the merged main just before the push named
  only this file; no evening was running (Saturday). After the push
  `migration list --linked` showed 87 local and 87 remote, no drift.
  **Hosted smoke test:** passed (the owner's run of the one-row query in KUT's
  `docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md`, 2026-10-03): `true | true | {30,10,4,2} | true |
  false | 2 | true | 0 | 2026-10-05`, matching the local run below and ending
  in the open week.
  Predictions for members who are out (MM 2.0 D, BUILD_SPEC §44.7, §44.9,
  §44.13, §44.14, §145, Part L #28, ADR-118 amending ADR-096; owner Q2
  interview 2026-10-03), in KUT PR #175. A member whose own match has ended
  in defeat picks the winner of each later match before its kick-off, once
  both its feeders have ended; correct picks pay 30 split over the matches
  after round 1 at the payout. Re-creates `wallet_ledger_reason_check` with
  `midweek_prediction` appended; adds `kut._mm_prediction_coins(integer)`
  (internal), `kut.midweek_predictions` and `kut.midweek_prediction_rewards`
  (RLS on, service role reads) with their guard triggers
  `kut._mm_guard_prediction()` and `kut._mm_guard_prediction_reward()` (Part L
  #28), `kut.save_midweek_prediction(uuid, integer, integer, uuid)`
  (authenticated, service role), and the views `kut.my_midweek_predictions`,
  `kut.my_midweek_prediction_rewards` and
  `kut.midweek_prediction_splits_public` (definer, gated on
  `kut.is_active_member()`); re-creates `kut._mm_pay_tournament(uuid)` with
  the wins step unchanged, then correct picks, then the result message with
  one more sentence for a member who predicted.
  **No DML at the push. Tier: data-changing** (it widens what the ledger
  accepts, adds a faucet and changes what the worker writes when it pays a
  week): fresh cold-verified backup before the push.
  **Reverse DDL** (no prediction saved yet, so nothing paid): re-create
  `kut._mm_pay_tournament` from `20261013000000_midweek_result_for_everyone.sql`;
  drop the three views, both tables, `kut.save_midweek_prediction`, both guard
  functions and `kut._mm_prediction_coins`; re-create the ledger constraint
  from `20261006000000_midweek_payouts.sql` section 1 once no ledger row has
  reason `midweek_prediction`.
  **Deploy ordering**: no KUT page reads any of it yet (the pages follow a
  design mock), so the Vercel deploy on merge changes nothing, and with no page
  nobody can save a pick, so the payout pays nothing extra. Not to be pushed
  while a Wednesday evening is running (lock to payout).
  Verified in the KUT repository: `supabase/tests/database/midweek_predictions.test.sql`
  (47), every other database suite (37 files, 1,575 assertions), the
  integration suites (7 files, 16 tests), authenticated E2E (49 passed, 1
  expected skip), and CI on KUT PR #175.
  **Hosted smoke test after the push**: the version recorded, the ledger
  reason, the coin rates for 2 to 5 rounds, the member's execute grant on the
  save, no member read on the table, both guard triggers, the payout paying
  picks, no picks yet and the open week. The local run returned
  `t | t | {30,10,4,2} | t | f | 2 | t | 0 |` (no week open locally; hosted
  should end in the open week).

- `20261018000000_special_snapshot_tiers.sql` (**applied 2026-10-04**, catalogue PR #79):
  KUT KB-038 / ADR-121, [KUT PR #184](https://github.com/VibeTrunk/kut/pull/184).
  Follows `20261017000000_midweek_predictions.sql`. Projection-only correction:
  collection, market, saved pack results and offered-card JSON read Specials'
  immutable `snapshot_rarity_tier`; Live tiers and missing-state floors remain.
  Preserves view column order/types, owners, grants, security modes and member
  gates. No DML, issuance, rating/pricing/economy change or snapshot rewrite.
  **Tier: additive.** Local KUT validation: 51 new pgTAP assertions; full suite
  38 files / 1,626 assertions and 7 integration files / 16 tests passed.
  The SQL is copied byte-for-byte from the reviewed KUT migration; catalogue
  verification includes this file.
  **Hosted application:** separately authorized by the owner, from merged
  central `main` `6c08eb0e84325a40185cf38034a6192c8dc4e78f`, after the canonical KUT
  release gate passed for `13185dc8000970ee5d42b54503973c17aa50327f`.
  Fresh backup `kut-backup-20261004-032324.sql.enc` was cold-verified independently
  at creation and again at gate time. All seven exact-candidate CI checks
  passed; unchanged authenticated Chromium/WebKit suite against a local
  production build: 130 passed, two duplicate pack-test skips (not passes).
  The first development-mode gate failed with five WebKit preview/layout
  timeouts; a focused rerun passed three/failed two, and the production-mode
  comparison passed all five before the complete gate passed. Cause unconfirmed;
  no tests/code/timeouts/skips were changed. Local Next 16.3.5; locked 16.3.6 CI
  passed. All fixtures were loopback-only.
  **Ledger:** 88 local/87 remote before, this sole pending migration; final
  central dry run named only this file. After: 88/88 match, zero pending;
  vault updates skipped. Source verification: 88 shared; KUT parity: 87.
  **Read-only hosted smoke:** all four definitions match tested local views;
  owners, ACLs, column order/types and security modes/barriers unchanged.
  Frozen Special count/hash unchanged (zero; none issued). Ordinary active
  member reads all four projections; collection tiers satisfy the contract.
  No hosted fixture rows/users created. Divergent Special tiers are covered by
  the local 51 pgTAP assertions. Details: KUT docs/DEPLOYMENTS.md.
  **Rollback:** re-create the four prior views from the source versions named
  in the SQL (collection: `20260911000000`; market: `20261010000000`; pack
  results: `20261002000000`; offers: `20260928000000`); no drop, edition rewrite
  or grant change. Rollback was prepared, not executed, and needs separate
  authorization. Frontend PR #183 and migration PR #184 were reviewed/merged
  separately; hosted SQL was applied only from this central repository.

- `20261019000000_basic_pack_price_250.sql` (**applied 2026-10-08**; KUT PR
  #207 / ADR-136, catalogue PR #81). Raises the `tfh-pack` definition price
  from 175 to 250 KUT Coins. Existing openings retain their recorded
  `price_paid` and ledger entries. The migration required exactly one matching
  definition row and changed only that row. **Tier: data-changing** (one
  `UPDATE` to a pack definition).
  **Application:** owner-authorized push from central `main`
  `dfdfcdebea55e77b0884aa1c269eb523f0ad5e52`. Before: 89 local / 88 remote,
  this sole local-only migration, no remote-only versions or drift; the dry run
  named only this file. The catalogue check matched 89 sources.
  **Backup:** the exact-SHA gate independently cold-verified
  `kut-backup-20261007-234906.sql.enc`; immediately before the DB push, fresh
  backup `kut-backup-20261008-001949.sql.enc` passed separate-process cold
  verification at `2026-10-07T22:20:22Z`.
  **After:** `migration list --linked` shows 89/89, zero pending and zero drift.
  Hosted smoke query found exactly one `tfh-pack` definition at price 250.
  The production gate passed for KUT SHA
  `c91903730f121a7c260fb588fc4b7bb4424c96d6`; the unchanged authenticated suite
  reported 175 passed, two approved duplicate-device skips, zero unexpected or
  flaky cases. An earlier run hit a WebKit sign-in timeout and two subsequent
  runs hit a Windows file lock during build cleanup; the final gate passed from
  a fresh ordinary checkout with no code, test, timeout or skip changes.
  Vercel deployment `dpl_DXBqscbVCbR5tLUvBazn6DSXqkcq` reached READY and
  `kut.vibetrunk.com` was verified live on that exact SHA at
  `2026-10-07T22:25:39Z`.
  **Rollback:** if needed, restore `price = 175` for `slug = 'tfh-pack'` only
  while the row still has `price = 250`; use a separately reviewed migration.
  Historical openings and ledger entries are left intact.

- `20261020000000_midweek_club_names.sql` (**applied 2026-10-11**; KUT PR
  #271 / ADR-145, catalogue PR #84). Re-creates the four Midweek views that
  name a member word for word and appends each member's club name
  (`side_0_club`/`side_1_club` on `midweek_matches_public` and
  `midweek_draw_public`, `club_name` on `midweek_entries_public`,
  `champion_club` on `midweek_tournaments_public`), defaulting to
  "<name>'s Club". Gates, definer, security barrier and grants unchanged.
  **Tier: additive** (views only, columns appended).
  **Application:** the first real run of the `apply-migrations` workflow
  (ADR-144), run 38155827216, catalogue `main`
  `7fa137a07e4646a140b4a98110b2d0a07018c5b0`, KUT ref
  `8cafe9d8e1bf9b6e04631c3d3b68ed1c5546bfdc`. The approved plan named only
  this file (sha256 `5af05887...40ac61`, matching KUT); the owner approved the
  plan and the apply.
  **Backup:** KUT backup run 38155567946 finished at `2026-10-11T16:31Z`,
  three minutes before the push.
  **After:** the workflow found the remote up to date, nothing pending.
  Hosted smoke query (as `service_role`): 62 visible matches, zero rows
  without a club in any of the four views. KUT PR #271 merged afterwards
  (`0272d3facb4a14d5103d53853e6830e4701b193f`).
  **Rollback:** re-create the four views from their previous migrations (named
  in the file's header), dropping each first, and re-apply grants and comments.

- `20261021000000_active_member_base_reads.sql` (**applied 2026-10-12**;
  KUT PR #292 / issue #286, ADR-152; catalogue PR #88). Requires
  `kut.is_active_member()` on 31 ungated
  member-readable base tables through restrictive SELECT policies, preserving
  their existing row scopes and grants. The private `player-photos` SELECT
  policy gains the same gate; other buckets and photo writes are unchanged.
  Own-profile reads remain for login's disabled-account check; admin-only
  reads and already-gated tables are unchanged. Definer views retain owner
  rights and gates; active admins and service role retain intended access.
  **Tier: additive, access-only** (policies only; no DML, grants or view changes).
  **Local evidence:** KUT's 212 focused assertions plus existing projection and
  rating-rule tests pass (310 total); fast verification passes (598 unit tests).
  Full pgTAP on a fresh isolated local stack: 1866/1866 pass (40 files).
  The existing reused stack has two failures (injury notice, Chronicle weekly
  goals), also present with old policies: current-week data violates those
  fixtures' assumptions. The same unchanged tests pass on the fresh stack.
  **Application:** owner-approved `apply-migrations` run
  [38227966186](https://github.com/VibeTrunk/supabase/actions/runs/38227966186),
  catalogue main `cc5cbb4da4a7f4e066dfb122ed844d3546bf38b1`, tested KUT head
  `aa516c87f14c75913774d051fff5d80974b3a6c8`. Only this file was pending;
  the apply job rechecked the approved list and pushed it at `09:28:15Z`.
  SHA-256 `0b631a9716828e9ac25699a1e34e7a6c5a98d0b4f6d0e23fcb1151cd6d5847fe`
  matches the tested SQL bytes. The post-push check found nothing pending.
  **Backup:** [38227500063](https://github.com/VibeTrunk/kut/actions/runs/38227500063)
  passed its independent restore check and finished at `09:07:19Z`; the apply
  job verified its age was 20 minutes. Encrypted artifact:
  `kut-backup-20261012T090447Z`.
  **Member smoke:** after KUT #292 merged as
  `e99fa0b656ac29a72aabee4903a292884bbb9e93` and production deployed that SHA,
  the owner reported all checks passed as a normal active member: Players,
  player detail/history/photo, Chronicle attendance/finalized results, and
  own Collection. No hosted fixtures were created and no member data printed.
  Direct hosted denial probes were not run; local pgTAP covers them.
  **Rollback:** drop the new restrictive policy on the migration's listed
  tables and restore the player-photo SELECT predicate to its bucket check.
  The SQL is byte-identical to KUT. Application followed ADR-144's reviewed
  central workflow; rollback remains separately authorized and was not run.
