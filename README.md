# VibeTrunk Supabase

Central migration catalogue for the single shared VibeTrunk Supabase project.

## Operator workflow

1. Make the schema change in the owning app repository and verify it locally.
2. Copy the immutable migration, unchanged, into this repository, add it to
   `scripts/verify-catalog.ps1` and run
   `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify-catalog.ps1`.
3. Review and merge the catalogue PR. For KUT, the order is in
   `docs/RELEASING.md` of `VBTRNK/kut`: its migration PR's database tests
   pass first, and its `catalogue-parity` check turns green only after this
   merge.
4. Apply with the **`apply-migrations`** workflow (KUT ADR-144):

   ```powershell
   gh workflow run backup.yml -R VBTRNK/kut   # a backup under an hour old
   gh workflow run apply-migrations.yml -R VBTRNK/supabase `
     -f catalogue_sha=<catalogue main SHA> -f kut_ref=<kut PR head SHA>
   ```

   Approve the `production` environment once to see the plan (the job summary
   lists every pending file and its SHA-256), then again to apply it. The plan
   refuses any pending migration without a byte-identical copy in
   `VBTRNK/kut`; the apply job pushes only an identical list and checks
   nothing is left pending. With nothing pending, the plan reports "up to date"
   and the apply job is skipped.

The workflow checks out the exact commit, so the old "`git pull` before
`db push`" trap no longer applies. Another tool's migrations need their own
route. A local `npx supabase db push` from this repository stays a fallback
only, with the owner's explicit OK for that push.

Individual tool repositories must never attempt to deploy their migrations to
the shared project. This prevents Supabase's global migration ledger from
mistaking another tool's already-applied migration for missing local work.

## Current hosted ledger

The shared ledger contains Cogitster's deployed
`202608160001_cogitster_solo.sql` baseline and KUT's applied migrations. The
latest applied migration is named in `CLAUDE.md`. Cogitster's
pending `202608160002_lock_down_trigger_execute.sql` is intentionally absent
until its own release is approved.

The per-migration notes below stop at 2026-08-31 and have not been kept up
since; [`CATALOGUE.md`](CATALOGUE.md) is the maintained record and carries
every catalogued migration. Read the list here as history, not as a complete
ledger.

- `20260818000000_initial_tfh_roster_and_august_sessions.sql` (applied
  2026-08-18): the first real TFH roster/attendance data, and the reweighted
  activity rating formula from KUT's ADR-024.
- `20260829000000_august_2026_full_month_roster_and_sessions.sql` (applied
  2026-08-29): the two remaining August 2026 sessions (21.08, 28.08) and four
  players who reached 2+ appearances (Steffen, Serhat, Stephen, Maarten).
- `20260829120000_admin_add_player.sql` and
  `20260829130000_admin_manage_roster.sql` (applied 2026-08-29): function-only.
  KUT's server-authoritative roster RPCs — `admin_add_player` (ADR-025) plus
  `admin_set_player_active` / `admin_delete_player` (ADR-026) — so admins add
  and remove TFH members from `/admin/roster` instead of a migration per
  roster change.
- `20260830000000_member_self_service_and_player_directory.sql`,
  `20260831000000_admin_links_username_and_attendance_messages.sql`,
  `20260901000000_admin_manage_accounts_and_leaderboard.sql` (**applied
  2026-08-30**): KUT's alpha-readiness batch (ADR-027..030).
  Adds the member-facing `player_directory` view and two ownership-gated
  self-service RPCs (own card photo + archetype), a **private `player-photos`
  storage bucket** with folder-scoped `storage.objects` RLS, `profiles.username`
  as a login handle, `admin_set_profile_player` / `admin_set_account_disabled`
  / `admin_prepare_account_deletion`, a dated attendance-reward inbox message
  with the amount raised 75 → 250 (not retroactive), and makes
  `club_value_leaderboard` members-only. Touches the `storage` schema and
  widens `public_live_ratings` / `my_collection_cards` / `club_value_leaderboard`
  (`create or replace view`, append-only). Rollback DDL is in each migration
  header.
- `20260902000000_starter_reveal_and_rating_snapshots.sql` (**applied
  2026-08-30**): KUT's ADR-031. `kut.player_rating_snapshots`
  + an `after`-trigger on `kut.player_season_state` that upserts a per-week OVR
  snapshot, the `kut.top_risers` view, `kut.profiles.starter_opened_at`
  (backfilled `= starter_claimed_at`), `kut.mark_starter_opened()`, and widens
  `kut.my_pack_opening_results` with `players.photo_path` (`create or replace
  view`, append-only). A migration-time seed inserts the current week's
  snapshots. Rollback DDL is in the migration header.
- `20260903000000_drop_is_tradeable.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-033 — retires the untradeable card concept. Drops
  `kut.user_cards.is_tradeable`, rebuilds the `kut.my_collection_cards` view
  (`drop view` + `create view` — a column can't be removed via `create or
  replace view`), and recreates `grant_starter_pack`, `open_pack`,
  `discard_card`, `get_listing_bounds`, `create_listing`, `buy_listing`
  without the flag. Data-changing tier (ADR-032): a fresh encrypted
  `kut`-schema backup was taken immediately before the push; reverse DDL is
  in the migration header and is lossless (every surviving row was
  `is_tradeable = true`). Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after KUT PR #17
  merged; hosted dump confirms zero `is_tradeable` references, the six
  recreated functions, and `user_cards` with no such column.
- `20260904000000_canonical_coin_name.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-034 (tester feedback #7). "KUT Coins" is now the one currency name.
  `create or replace` of `kut.open_pack` + `kut.buy_listing` (latest
  `20260903000000` bodies) with `TF Coins` → `KUT Coins` in the two
  insufficient-funds `raise` strings and the two `market_purchase` /
  `market_sale` notification `format()` bodies, then a one-shot
  `update kut.user_notifications set body = replace(body, 'TF Coins', 'KUT
  Coins') where event_type in ('market_purchase','market_sale') and body like
  '%TF Coins%'` for rows already on hosted. Data-changing tier (ADR-032) only
  for that backfill: fresh encrypted backup immediately before the push;
  reverse `replace()` in the migration header, scoped to the same
  `event_type`s so it is lossless (`attendance_reward` bodies already said
  "KUT Coins"). No economy value, ledger `reason`, column, price, or formula
  change. Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after KUT PR #19 merged; a hosted
  `kut` dump shows zero `TF Coins` references and "KUT Coins" in both
  `open_pack` / `buy_listing` raises and both `buy_listing` notification
  bodies.
- `20260905000000_admin_economy_tools.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's
  ADR-035 (tester feedback #8 + #6). Two `is_admin()`-gated security-definer
  RPCs, one audit table, one widened check constraint.
  `kut.admin_adjust_wallet(uuid, bigint, text)` — audited coin faucet, both
  directions, `abs` cap 100000 (`22023`), never below zero (`P0001`), typed
  1–200-char reason; `wallet_ledger.reason 'admin_grant'` + a
  `kut.admin_account_events` row + an `admin_notice` inbox message.
  `kut.admin_reset_account(uuid, uuid)` — soft reset: cancels active listings,
  soft-burns owned cards, deletes pack history + notifications, zeroes the
  wallet via a `-(balance)` + `+250` ledger pair (`reason 'admin_reset'`,
  net 250), re-grants the 3-card starter inline, nulls `starter_opened_at` to
  replay `/welcome`; keeps `market_sales`, market ledger rows and
  `attendance_rewards` guard rows; idempotent on `p_idempotency_key`.
  `kut.admin_account_events` audit table (admin-read RLS like
  `password_reset_events`). `wallet_ledger.reason` check widened with
  `admin_grant` / `admin_reset`. **Additive tier (ADR-032)**: all `create
  table` / `create or replace function` / one widened check; no data migration
  (the reset mutates rows at run time), so it rode the last scheduled backup —
  no fresh pre-push backup. Reverse DDL in the migration header (`drop
  function` / `drop table` / restore the narrower check). Pushed from this repo
  2026-08-31 after KUT PR #21 + catalogue PR #15 merged; a hosted `kut` dump
  confirms `kut.admin_account_events` (+ its partial unique index and RLS
  policy), both RPCs (`revoke … from public` + `grant … to authenticated`),
  and `wallet_ledger_reason_check` now listing `admin_grant` + `admin_reset`.
  `migration list --linked` shows `20260905000000` Local = Remote, no drift.
- `20260906000000_goalkeeper_archetype.sql`,
  `20260907000000_bibs_bonus.sql`,
  `20260908000000_activity_feed.sql` (**applied 2026-08-31**): KUT's Batch E
  (tester feedback #4 / #5 / #10 — ADR-036 / 037 / 038), the last
  tester-feedback batch. All three **additive tier (ADR-032)** — pushed as one
  `db push` on the last scheduled backup, no fresh pre-push backup; reverse
  DDL in each migration header.
  - **E1 — Goalkeeper archetype:** a seventh archetype reusing the six shared
    attributes with its own offset row (`pac -6, sho -12, pas 0, dri -8,
    def +14, phy +12`; sums to 0). Widens the `kut.players` archetype `check`
    (drop auto-named inline constraint by lookup, re-add as
    `players_archetype_check`) and `create or replace`s `admin_add_player`,
    `set_own_player_archetype`, and `_rebuild_season_core` (a
    `when 'goalkeeper'` arm on each of the six attribute `CASE`s — the ADR-024
    formula restated). No player pre-assigned; the rebuild arm is inert until a
    player opts in, so no data change.
  - **E2 — bibs-washing coin bonus:** `+100` KUT Coins for the session's bibs
    washer, coins only. Adds nullable `kut.match_sessions.bibs_washed_by`, the
    `kut.bibs_rewards` guard table (PK `(session_id, player_id)`, member/admin
    RLS — a shape match to `attendance_rewards`), `kut.grant_bibs_reward(uuid)`
    (called from `process_published_session_rewards`), and widens
    `wallet_ledger.reason` + `user_notifications.event_type` with `bibs_bonus`.
    `publish_attendance_session` / `correct_published_attendance_session` each
    gain a trailing `p_bibs_washed_by uuid default null` — a `create or
    replace` can't widen the arg list, so the old 4-/5-arg signatures are
    **dropped and recreated**. Forward-only on corrections.
  - **E3 — activity newsfeed:** one read-only `kut.activity_feed` view
    (`security_invoker = false`, `security_barrier = true`, `grant select to
    authenticated` — the `club_value_leaderboard` pattern), `union all` of
    completed sales, active listings, pack openings and published sessions.
    A completed-sale row now exposes the buyer name club-wide (was
    buyer+seller-only).
  Pushed from this repo 2026-08-31 after KUT PRs #23 / #24 / #25 + catalogue
  PR #17 merged. `migration list --linked` shows all three Local = Remote, no
  drift on the 36 prior migrations. A hosted `kut` dump confirms:
  `players_archetype_check` lists `goalkeeper` and both roster RPC allow-lists
  carry the seven-value list; `kut.match_sessions.bibs_washed_by`,
  `kut.bibs_rewards`, `kut.grant_bibs_reward`, and `bibs_bonus` in both widened
  checks; `publish_/correct_` attendance functions present only as the new
  5-/6-arg signatures (old ones gone), granted to `authenticated` +
  `service_role`; and `kut.activity_feed` with its `authenticated` select
  grant.
